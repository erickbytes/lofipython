                <p>Being a programmer is not just about learning new libraries and skills.
Some would say that identifying oneself as a &quot;programmer&quot; is foolish.
What we really are is problem solvers. We apply technology or logic to achieve an ends to a mean.
This post details an interesting problem I encountered and how I reasoned to fix it.</p>
<p>I use Google Authenticator as my two factor authorization app. For many websites I use,
this is a layer of security to verify it is actually me signing in.</p>
<p>I started using the app and went years with no problems. Recently, I encountered an issue signing
into my 401K provider's website to check on my 401k. I logged in with my username and password,
then went to the authenticator app when prompted for a code.</p>
<p>But this time, after trying multiple times, I received the error &quot;code invalid&quot;.
After so many failed attempts, most websites will lock you out of your account.
This ended up happening to me.</p>
<p>Frustrated, I called the provider's customer support. Eventually, I regained access to my account.
&quot;There's something bonked with my Authenticator app! The codes aren't working.&quot;, I told them.
They had no solutions, since the app is from Google and they are a financial services company.</p>
<p>I moved on from the debacle. A month or so later on a different website, this time
a cryptocurrency exchange, I attempted to log in. Once again, the codes were invalid.
I tried multiple times, but seeing it wouldn't work I stopped before a lock was placed on my account.</p>
<p>Since I was dealing with a Google product, I consulted Google Gemini AI model to seek guidance.</p>
<img alt="asking Google Gemini for help with Google Authenticator" src="https://lofipython.com/images/asking-google-gemini-authenticator-issue.png" />
<p>The solution to my problem was just as Gemini suggested: &quot;Google Authenticator relies on precise time precision.&quot;
Although the specific solution Gemini offered was not correct, it sent me searching in the right direction.
Gemini told me there was a &quot;time sync setting&quot; in the Authenticator app that didn't exist. Gemini did mention that my phone
should be on &quot;network time&quot;.</p>
<p>Bingo. I opened up the time settings on my cellular phone. I had manually been setting my time zone due to traveling.
I opened up my phone and enabled my automatic time settings:</p>

<p>Success! My phone's time settings caused Google Authenticator to display the wrong codes. I logged into my account,
making a mental note that my cell phone clock's settings can indeed cause my two factor authentication app to stop working.</p>
