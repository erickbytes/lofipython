                <p>We move in cycles. Work, rest, re-energize, play, repeat. The rhythm of
life.</p>
<p>I began my coding endeavors in the fall of 2015. After 6 months of
steady <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/03/11/random-findings/">coding practice and studying</a>, I
went from no knowledge to a basic hobbyist programmer capable of
creating a website with the help of <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/03/03/starting-to-almost-kinda-think-about-creating-a-web-app/">a framework</a>.
I published a few of my own primitive apps. Then I relapsed. Coding and
my full-time job wore me out. I stayed away from coding for about 6
months.</p>
<p>My ultimate goal to learn to code was to be able to build my own
websites and apps. I've done that now. I've found ways to do it more
efficiently, which I will share in future posts.</p>
<p>Two of my recent moonshot projects were Social Queues, a social playlist
builder for Spotify and Dropcycle, a bicycle on demand pick-up service.
Neither went anywhere, or really were that good of ideas, but I was able
to get to bare minimum viable product status, with little to no code.
Sites like <a class="reference external" href="http://carrd.co">carrd.co</a> work well to build a quick
landing page as proof of concept or landing page test. My favorite
project might be my <a class="reference external" href="http://tameimpala.pythonanywhere.com/tameimpala">Tame Impala website</a>,
which I used <a class="reference external" href="https://lofipython.com/getting-started-with-web2py/">web2py</a>
to build the site and <a class="reference external" href="http://pythonanywhere.com">pythonanywhere</a> to host for free.</p>
<p>My aspirations have shifted. Instead of just building apps, I want to
build apps that are useful to others and help me achieve financial
freedom and the ability to own my time.</p>
<p>I believe in cycles of learning. Similar to being in school: semester of
study, then time off to rest, then semester of study, more rest, etc.
The time away is as important as the time of study. Earlier this year, I
returned to programming and web development. After a long time of not
writing on this blog, I'm back at it. New cycle.</p>
