                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Being a developer has similarities to the life of a family surviving in space. Sure, the stakes are lower when writing code versus being chased by alien life forms, but the core idea is the same. One is faced with a problem and it must be solved, with varying degrees of consequences for failure.</p>
<p>I enjoyed watching the Robinsons solve problem after problem to stay alive in alien worlds and the vacuum of space. I believe you can learn from anything. <strong>So in that spirit, here are some lessons from the show for us problem solving humans:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><img alt="tayrob" class="size-full wp-image-2271 alignright" src="https://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/tayrob.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 168px;" />Don't panic when you're in trouble. A cool head is vitally important to your survival chances when you're in a bind. Judy demonstrates this quality in evading the&nbsp;raptor-like creatures chasing her.</li>
<li>Problems solved often lead to more problems to solve. We would be wise to anticipate what might happen if we do succeed.</li>
<li>Be cautious when venturing into unfamiliar territories. You never know what could be there to trip you up. Which leads me to my next point...</li>
<li>Respect nature's ability to f*ck you up. The environment you're in, other organisms, and bacteria can wreak havoc. Despite our perceived self-importance, nature is our god. We are but specks in its creation. Cases in point: the metal-dissolving virus that destroys Judy's chariot and the poisonous algae Don accidentally discovers that immobilizes him.</li>
<li>Know when to go for broke, or when to re-group and wait to make your next move. The Robinsons spent 7 months stocking up at their new beach home. Until they suffered a setback...<img alt="beach" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2279" src="https://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/beach.jpg" style="width: 2155px; height: 1181px;" /></li>
<li>Adapt your plan when new information becomes available or unexpected events happen. They will happen.</li>
<li>Think of unconventional ways to use the resources you do have to fix the problem at hand. Who would have thought a spaceship could be retrofitted into a boat?</li>
<li>Things often work 83% of the way you expect them to work. Sometimes that's enough to move on. Or maybe it buys you enough time to figure out your next move. The electrical field stalled the fleet of robots long enough for the Robinsons to realize the children should &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies">Lord of the Flies</a>&quot; their way to Alpha Centauri.</li>
<li>Question your own motivations, and be open to changing course if you are wrong. Adler realized he should help Will save Scarecrow's life after first trying to stop him. Scarecrow then exhibits this same quality when he turns against his robot comrades to save the children.</li>
<li>Ethics and morals may conflict with each other. Was Maureen Robinson wrong for fraudulently saving her son Will? Ethically, yes. But morally, as a mother saving her son? No.</li>
<li>Make time for your family and friends. Maureen was so busy saving the family that she didn't read Penny's book. Stop and smell the roses every once in a while. Or read your daughter's damn book.</li>
<li>Humans are capable of both great compassion and horrible cruelty. We're running from alien robots, but sometimes we're the monsters? Cough cough Smith and Hastings... cough. Excuse me. (smh 🤦)</li>
<li><img alt="robot" class="wp-image-2282 alignright" src="https://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/robot-1.jpeg" style="width: 358px; height: 179px;" />I'll spare you any parallels about modern artificial intelligence. The best, most grounded definition I've heard of modern AI is &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1214392496375025664?lang=en">automated cognition</a>&quot;.</li>
<li>Self-sacrifice is an honorable death to save the lives of others, but can be frustrating to watch on TV. &quot;Did you really have to kill yourself there?&quot; - me, several times during the show 😆</li>

                <p><em>I am finally starting to understand</em><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">git version control</a><em>! It makes developing a project on different computers easy. Some of these notes were picked up from the super informative</em><a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZEWDGpM-vM">Reproducible Data Analysis in Jupyter video series</a><em>by Jake VanderPlas, author of the</em><a class="reference external" href="https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/">Python Data Science Handbook</a><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>First,</em><a class="reference external" href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">go here</a><em>, download and install git if you haven't yet. Alright, here are my go-to steps and commands for git:</em></p>
<p><strong>Beginning a New Project With Git</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Create new repository on GitHub</li>
<li>Add a README</li>
<li>Add a Python gitignore</li>
<li>Add a license (Jake V. used an MIT license)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Clone Any Repository from GitHub</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Visit your new project, or any GitHub project, click the green &quot;Clone or download&quot; button and copy the link.</li>
<li>In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you want to clone your project.</li>
<li>In terminal, enter: <tt class="docutils literal">git clone PASTE_URL_HERE</tt></li>
<li>Now cd into your project folder.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Push Your Local Computer Changes to the Master Repository</strong></p>
<p>Let's say you did some work on your computer and want to push the changes to GitHub. Enter these commands in terminal:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">git add .</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">git commit <span class="pre">-m</span> &quot;Add your commit note here&quot;</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">git push origin master</tt></li>
</ol>
<p>*Above: <tt class="docutils literal">git add .</tt> = stage all files in project directory for master</p>
<p>**Substitute <tt class="docutils literal">git add path\to\file\here</tt> to stage only a single file to add to your master repository.</p>
<p><strong>Fetch Changes From Master Branch to Your Local Computer</strong></p>
<p>I like to update my local computer with any master branch changes before beginning work on it. Enter these commands in terminal:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">git fetch</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">git pull origin master</tt></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Review Merge Conflicts</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, your code may conflict with changes in the master branch. You'll find out if you try to push or pull changes and the auto-merge fails. Use &quot;git status&quot; to locate the files with the conflicts. Enter in your terminal:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">git status</tt></li>
<li>Then <a class="reference external" href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line">follow these instructions</a> to review the merge conflicts.</li>
</ol>
<p>See also: <a class="reference external" href="https://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/conflicts.html">Resolving Conflicts - Virtualenv Documentation</a></p>
<p><strong>Or maybe you want to discard any local changes, then merge:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">git fetch</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">git checkout .</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">git pull origin master</tt></li>
</ol>

                <p>The text editor is a core tool for writing software. I've always used Atom. Lately, I've noticed my Atom text editor was bogging down on my Chromebook running Ubuntu 16.04. Keystrokes and mouse movements were lagging and slowing my coding down. I'm also getting low on disk space, which may be a related issue.</p>
<p>You'll want to choose a text editor based on how it suits your own needs. In this case, I want a light-weight, responsive editor with no lag. Bells and whistles are less important. I'm also looking to minimize disk space required.</p>
<p>I decided to compare the <a class="reference external" href="https://codeburst.io/a-beginners-guide-to-using-apt-get-commands-in-linux-ubuntu-d5f102a56fc4">apt installed</a> package size of some popular editors.&nbsp;First, I installed Atom, Emacs, Sublime, VS Code and Vim using the Ubuntu 16.04 terminal. You&nbsp;could also consider using <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/idle.html">IDLE, python's built-in text editor</a> as an alternative that requires no additional software.</p>
<p><strong>Then I</strong> <a class="reference external" href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/40442/which-installed-software-packages-use-the-most-disk-space-on-debian">found the below command</a> <strong>to list all installed apt packages by package size on Ubuntu:</strong></p>
<pre class="literal-block">

<p><strong>Results: Vim and Sublime win for smallest installed package size.</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Vim is the lightest-weight package of these 5 popular text editors, with Sublime not far behind. Emacs is comparable to them for usability and relatively small.</li>
<li>Atom is nearly 3x the size of VS Code and 20x the size of Vim. Atom and VS Code are larger than the Firefox browser package, the third largest of any downloaded package on my system.</li>
<li>I tested out all of the editors by opening the same Python file and making some edits. I found Vim, Emacs and Sublime were much more responsive than Atom and VS Code.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Conclusion: All Editors Are Not Created Equal</strong></p>
<p>These are fine editors when paired with the right machine and developer needs. In my case, a Chromebook running Linux installed with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton">Crouton</a>, a few editors are performing faster and taking up less space. I've chosen Sublime or Emacs as my editor for this computer. One slightly annoying feature of Sublime is being prompted to buy the paid version from the trial version. Atom, Emacs, Vim and VS Code are free. Vim might be a good option if I ever decide to conquer its <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-do-i-exit-the-vim-editor">notoriously high learning curve</a>.</p>

<p><strong>An Introductory Rant on Testing</strong></p>
<p>Over several years as a programmer, I've slowly grasped the landscape of testing in software development. After moving beyond my first few tutorials and projects, it seemed very noisy to sort out. Examples provided are usually simple assertions that seem tough to relate to a real use case. It might be easy test the wrong things. Plus, some don't do it at all! The quality of the tests is more important than the quantity. But what makes a quality test? Where's the balance between testing every minute detail of a program and not at all?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yeah. And the worst thing that happens is that you get people that just stop&nbsp;<em>thinking</em>&nbsp;about what they’re doing. “This is the principle, to always write unit tests, so I’m always going to write unit tests,” and then they’re just not thinking about how they’re spending their time, and they wind up wasting a lot of it.</p>
<p>Joel Spolsky, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2009/01/">Stack Overflow Podcast #38</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Implementing software tests is a best practice for maintaining code, but seems ambiguous to someone who has not tested any code before. I guess the best way is to <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/iodide-project/pyodide/tree/master/test">read open source projects with test suites</a>, but those can be tough to find. How do you know <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/reading/">a good test suite</a> when you see it? Maybe the maintainers went rogue and off the deep end with tests. Online, everybody says you should test your code, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor%27s_New_Clothes">is the emperor wearing any clothes?</a></p>
<p>As a beginner stumbling across articles on testing, these questions were tough to answer. As with most things in programming, figuring out the right question to ask is a challenge in itself. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3">Codeacademy</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python">Coursera</a> never mentioned anything about writing tests. On the other hand, <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/intro/tutorial05/">Django</a> includes testing in its tutorial and documentation. Also, most languages come with built-in testing tools. Python has the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html">unittest</a> library.</p>
<p><strong>Why test at all? First, some solid benefits of software testing:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>With tests on your code in place, you can implement changes and have confidence the code still works if the tests pass. This gives developers more confidence to iterate and improve an application.</li>
<li>Detect problems faster. Passing tests are a good indicator that your programs are actually doing what they're supposed to do. If they don't pass, you likely found a bug you might have missed otherwise.</li>
<li>When you find a bug, you either need to amend your code, or your tests. write a test for that bug and then fix it. Either that, or you need to be amend your tests. You've just improved the quality of your test suite.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://daedtech.com/dont-learn-to-code-learn-to-automate/">Automation</a>. If you are writing tests, those tests can be automated. If you are manually checking the results of your program, you're missing a chance to automate those checks away. I haven't applied it yet, but have heard the <a class="reference external" href="https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Tox library</a> may be useful to automate tests related to Python packaging. For more on automating tests, see this PyCon talk, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BHverY7IwU">Three Excellent Python Tools to Automate Repetitive Tasks</a>.</li>
<li>Test Driven Development can decrease the time spent debugging code. This claim sometimes lacks empirical evidence, supporting evidence tends to be anecdotal.</li>
</ul>

<p>A good unit test, therefore, is one that helps enforce the contract to which the function is committed.</p>
<p>If a good unit test breaks, the contract is violated and should be either explicitly amended (by changing the documentation and tests), or fixed (by fixing the code and leaving the tests as is).</p>
<p>A good unit test is also&nbsp;<em>strict</em>. It does its best to ensure the output is valid. This helps it catch more bugs.</p>

<p><strong>Pytest and Unit Testing in Python</strong></p>
<p>This is where the Python hits the pavement. Unit tests are generally liked, although some prefer property tests or integration tests because they think the scope of unit tests is too narrow. The <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html">unittest</a> library is Python's default testing framework. However nowadays, <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/contents.html">pytest</a> seems to be the preferred unit testing framework for Python. <a class="reference external" href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Hypothesis</a> is another popular framework I've read about.</p>

<p>I think&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">hypothesis</a>&nbsp;is probably underrated—some libraries are hesitant to incorporate it into their testing frameworks, but I think the property-based testing has real potential to catch scenarios humans would have a hard time anticipating, or at least that would take a long time to properly plan for. I find that hypothesis almost always adds a few useful test cases I hadn’t thought of that will require special error handling, for example.</p>

<p>Traditional, or example-based, testing specifies the behavior of your software by writing examples of it—each test sets up a single concrete scenario and asserts how the software should behave in that scenario. Property-based tests take these concrete scenarios and generalize them by focusing on which features of the scenario are essential and which are allowed to vary. This results in cleaner tests that better specify the software’s behavior—and that better uncover bugs missed by traditional&nbsp;testing.</p>

<p><strong>Test Driven Development</strong></p>
<p>Eventually, you'll discover the evangelists preaching Test Driven Development. There are certain discussions which polarize us in the software development world, such as the appropriate scenarios to deploy this system of development.</p>
<p>Opinions vary widely on the merits and appropriate application of TDD. I'm admittedly skeptical but do see the merits of TDD. But which flavor? Where do unit tests and integration tests fit in? How many tests should I write? What exactly should I be testing? <a class="reference external" href="https://georgestocker.com/2019/12/10/is-pair-programming-tdd-worth-it/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=is-pair-programming-tdd-worth-it">This essay</a> claims anyone pair programming software with an expected life of 3 or more years should use Test Driven Development.</p>

<div class="line">I write programs for personal productivity and to <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/11/25/automated-python-with-windows-task-scheduler/">automate processes</a> at my company. The scope of problems my code solves has grown with my programming ability. I'm now reaching the point where I can apply tests to my advantage. However, sometimes I'll write a quick-hitter script for which I can't justify writing tests. Beyond those cases, testing can help if you pick the right style for your project. More so for recurring, automated processes.</div>
</div>
<p>It feels pretty cool when your tests run and you know with more certainty whether a part of your program is getting the job done or not. After setting up my first test with pytest, I have leveled up to novice tester, instead of blissfully not knowing what I don't know about testing. That's a step in the right direction.</p>

                <p>I recently automated the loading of data into a Microsoft Access database with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki">pyodbc</a>, a Python library for connecting to databases. ODBC stands for <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Database_Connectivity">Open Database Connectivity</a>. It can be used for a variety of Database Management Systems outside of Access also.</p>
<p><strong>First,</strong> <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html">install libraries with pip</a><strong>. Enter in terminal or command prompt:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">

<p><strong>Drivers for</strong> <strong>Access &amp; Many Other Data Sources</strong></p>
<p>The driver is the engine that allows you to connect to a specific type of database. The drivers available vary depending on your machine.</p>
<p>The two most common drivers for Access are Microsoft Access Driver (<em>.mdb) and Microsoft Access Driver (</em>.mdb, *.accdb). My computer only had *.mdb, which has been deprecated. My Access database was a .mdb file, so I was able to use this driver as shown below. Read more on Access drivers <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mkleehammer/pyodbc/wiki/Connecting-to-Microsoft-Access">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
&quot;Drivers exist for all major DBMSs, many other data sources like address book systems and Microsoft Excel, and even for text or comma-separated values (CSV) files.&quot;&nbsp; - <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Database_Connectivity">Wikipedia</a></blockquote>
<p><strong>Database Data Types</strong></p>
<p>I set all of the field data types to &quot;Short Text&quot; because I'm passing strings as SQL parameters below. Uploading as other data types may require additional formatting. To edit the data types of your table, open the table and select &quot;Design View&quot; under the &quot;Home&quot; tab. It got the job done for me!</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Running the above in command prompt uses pyodbc and SQL to add dataframe rows to a Microsoft Access DB table named &quot;Cats&quot;. Passing each row as a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/#paramstyle">SQL parameter</a> has two benefits:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>It handles strings with single quotes (') and loads them to the DB.</li>
<li>It protects against <a class="reference external" href="https://www.acunetix.com/websitesecurity/sql-injection/">SQL injection</a> attacks.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Access Limitation Disclaimer</strong></p>
<p>Access topped out just shy of 10 million rows in my use case, when records stopped getting added to my database. So keep that in mind if you're thinking about using Access to store your data.</p>

                <p><strong>So you want to run your Python scripts automatically, but how?</strong></p>
<p>I had heard of several popular scheduling libraries in Python like <a class="reference external" href="http://www.celeryproject.org/">celery</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.pyinvoke.org/">Invoke</a>, and&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/dbader/schedule">schedule</a>. One of my requirements is to run the python file &quot;in the background&quot;, not in command prompt or an open window.</p>
<p>Enter Windows Task Scheduler, the de facto scheduler on Windows 7 computers. I have&nbsp; scheduled a few scripts and it is working like a charm. In this post, I will schedule an example script to clean up my desktop at the beginning of each day. I have a habit of accumulating many Excel files there throughout the workday. This example automatically moves them into a folder.</p>
<p>Other Windows scheduling alternatives worth mentioning include <a class="reference external" href="http://thepythoncorner.com/dev/how-to-create-a-windows-service-in-python/">creating a Windows service</a>, or using <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/taskschd/schtasks">schtasks</a> if you prefer the command line.</p>
<p><strong>Here's how to schedule a Python script to run:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Search for Windows Task Scheduler in the start menu. Then select &quot;Task Scheduler Library&quot; to see all of the tasks Windows is running automatically.</li>
<li>In the right toolbar, select &quot;Create Basic Task&quot; and give it a name and description. Note: I selected &quot;Configure for: Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2&quot;.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li>Set the time and frequency that the program will run in the &quot;Triggers&quot; tab.</li>
<li>Under the &quot;Actions&quot; tab, select &quot;Start a Program&quot; from the dropdown. Under &quot;Program/Script&quot;, enter the path to your Python.exe file. I set mine to a Python executable located within my <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/04/10/creating-isolated-python-environments-with-virtualenv/">virtual environment</a>, but yours might be found wherever you have Python installed.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="literal-block">
C:\Users\your_username\Desktop\36env\Scripts\python.exe
</pre>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>Under &quot;Add arguments (optional)&quot;, add the path to your .py script, within quotes:</li>
</ol>
<pre class="literal-block">
&quot;C:\Users\your_username\Desktop\36env\clean_desktop_excels.py&quot;
</pre>

<ol class="arabic simple" start="6">
<li>Select additional conditions and settings as desired, such as &quot;Wake the computer to run this task&quot; and &quot;Run with highest privileges&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am enjoying this simple, easy and convenient scheduling manager for Windows. I figured most of this out thanks to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/product/analytics/scheduling-a-python-script-or-model-to-run-at-a-prescribed-time/?rmedium=redirect&amp;rsource=/esri/arcgis/2013/07/30/scheduling-a-scrip">this blog</a>. Below is my script to clean my desktop each morning by moving my Excel files into a folder, using Python's stock <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html">shutil</a> and os libraries.

                    <a href="https://lofipython.com/gooey-gui-for-python-scripts.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to &quot;Gooey GUI for Python Scripts&quot;">Gooey GUI for Python Scripts</a>
                </h2>

                
                

                <p>GUI stands for &quot;Graphical User Interface&quot;, aka the part of a program designed for human interaction. Adding a GUI to a Python script allows anyone to run it without having to code or use the command line.</p>
<p>There are several GUI libraries in Python. A few I have heard of are Tkinter (comes in the standard library), wxPython, PyQT, easygui, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui">DearPyGui</a> and PySimpleGUI. I <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/02/29/tkinter-and-python-libraries/">explored Tkinter</a> back when I first got into Python. It was more intricate and offered more control over the look of your app, and took longer to pick up. Gooey is more of a pre-packaged GUI library.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey">Gooey Github page</a> was most useful to me and helped me to do what I needed. The script posted <a class="reference external" href="http://pbpython.com/pandas-gui.html">in this blog</a> helped as well. I needed to enable a human to supply three files and enter a number. Gooey was a good match for this. The library has two branches:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>some basic widgets piggyback off the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2015/10/08/a-intro-to-argparse/">argparse</a> library</li>
<li>another part of the library uses a function called the GooeyParser. The GooeyParser offers more advanced widgets, like a file chooser. This was exactly what I was looking to use to pull in files for my script.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Installing Gooey</strong></p>
<p>Argparse comes stock with Python. You can install Gooey via the <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/01/20/how-to-python-pip-install-new-libraries/">pip installer</a>. Open command prompt or terminal and enter:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">python <span class="pre">-m</span> pip install Gooey</tt></p>
<p>Below is a basic argparse/Gooey combination script. The argparse version offers a handful of widgets such as checkboxes and dropdown, but I had trouble getting them to work with the GooeyParser (used in 2nd script).</p>

Side note: Check out Python's <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#vars">vars() built-in</a> function above. It returns the input data as a dictionary called user_inputs. Then we can get the values via the dictionary's keys. Pretty nifty!</blockquote>
<p>The &#64;Gooey() part of the code is an advanced function known as a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/">decorator in Python</a>. Put simply, decorators are functions that modify the function to which they are attached.</p>
<p>Below is my script that uses the more advanced GooeyParser for its &quot;FileChooser&quot; widget. Gooey allows you to group widgets together and set how many widgets per line with the gooey_options={} parameter.</p>

<p>Overall, Gooey knows what it wants to be, an easy to use GUI framework for Python. It does it well. Here's a screenshot of my program's shiny GUI:</p>
<img alt="gooey_gui_shot_2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1431" src="https://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/gooey_gui_shot_2.png" style="width: 578px; height: 603px;" />
<p>Now that I have a GUI on top of my program and it delivers the expected output file, I'm hoping to take it one step further by packaging it up as a Windows .exe file. This would allow it to run as a desktop app on any Windows computer without the need to install Python or library dependencies. I've only begun exploring options to do this but a few libraries I've heard of are pyinstaller, cx_Freeze and Py2Exe. Updates coming if I figure it out. Cheers :D</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I did figure out how to compile my Gooey app to a Windows application with Pyinstaller. You can&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/11/20/packaging-python-as-a-windows-app/">read more on how I did it here</a>.</p>

                <p>Findstr is the Windows alternative to GREP, which runs on the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.howtogeek.com/182649/htg-explains-what-is-unix/">Unix operating system</a>. Findstr searches files with <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression">regular expressions</a> and seems useful for string matching within files and directories.&nbsp; It is one of over <a class="reference external" href="https://www.lifewire.com/list-of-command-prompt-commands-4092302">280 command prompt commands</a>. Here's the official&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/findstr">Windows Documentation</a>&nbsp;and some&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://www.mkyong.com/linux/grep-for-windows-findstr-example/">Linux vs. Windows Examples.</a></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Windows announced that <a class="reference external" href="https://hackaday.com/2019/06/10/windows-10-goes-to-shell/">Grep and several other Unix command line tools will be added to Windows 10</a>. This is a new alternative to findstr.</p>
<p><strong>This findstr command returns all lines containing an '&#64;' in a text file.</strong></p>
<pre class="literal-block">
findstr &#64; test.txt
</pre>
<img alt="findstr Emails" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1406" src="https://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/findstr-emails.png" style="width: 602px; height: 48px;" />
<p><strong>I was happy to see Findstr's convenient help menu:</strong></p>
<pre class="literal-block">
findstr -?

<p>Regular expressions are so powerful. It's nice to have this utility within the command prompt. I am hoping to get to know some of the other 280 command prompt commands.</p>
<p><strong>I've previously explored regex with Python. This Python regex example finds all words in a text file containing '&#64;' symbols:</strong></p>
<pre class="literal-block">
import re


# read the file to string + regex email search
with open('test.txt', 'r') as fhand:
    string = fhand.read()
    # this regex returns a python list of emails:
    emails = re.findall('(\S*&#64;\S+)', string)
    print(emails)
</pre>
