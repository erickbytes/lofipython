                <p>When assessing your environment, problem or your goal, meticulously scout the tools at your disposal. When you're learning a new job, a new project or a programming language's tools for example, it pays to have a grasp of your options. Researching what documentation, guides, tools or libraries are at your disposal will help you accomplish your goal. That sounds obvious but here's what I mean.</p>
<p>Seek out resources. Bookmark links and support info in an Excel spreadsheet with a handful of columns, for example. Soon, you'll amass a collection tools and guides to get things done. Most companies or products have &quot;resource centers&quot;, mountains of internal documentation, tools and blogs. At many organizations, people have likely made tools for something they needed in the past then moved on. Often these tools can be leveraged for anyone who cares enough to seek out, read about and learn how to use them. Dig for these tools too. Find resources by googling products you use. Subscribe to their <a class="reference external" href="https://status.box.com/">status pages</a>. Look for other tools that may help you in a pinch like <a class="reference external" href="https://support.goto.com/webinar/system-check-attendee">GoToWebinar's system check</a> to help someone figure out what's wrong with their browser. I love these types of browser-based troubleshooting software. These are ways to gain a better understanding of technologies that might affect or improve your productivity or day to day goals.</p>
<p>I think of &quot;resource scoping&quot; as crawling these types of resources for every tool, guide and support contact that might good to know. The effort you put in to scope available resources is worth the time spent. Check out the &quot;resource scoping&quot; I did in <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.com/2021/05/29/python-libraries-tools-resources-for-creative-and-academic-writers/">this post I wrote focused on tools for writers</a>!</p>

                <p>This morning I'm meditating on my usual apps or websites I visit through the course of a typical day. I wonder how limited or expansive it could be in the span of all that's waiting to be consumed on the internet. I like reading online or physical books too and writing. Consider your own circle of the internet. What sites do you frequent? What do you consume? This is more rhetorical. It's good to pose the question and consider what you might be missing. I recently downloaded a bunch of nature and hiking apps. Maybe that means I want more of that in my life. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgw_yprN_-w&amp;ab_channel=LiliDVLima">Happy trails</a>.</p>

                <p>In September 2021, I tested out the recommended ads runner, <a class="reference external" href="https://wordads.co/">WordAds</a>, on this WordPress blog. 6,182 ads were served over the course of a month, earning $0.86 from impressions and clicks. My average CPM or cost per thousand impressions was $0.14. My blog averages about 1,600 views a month at the moment, mostly fueled by various search engines. Here's an example of one ad that ran:</p>
<div class="wp-image-6185 figure">
<img alt="**Example Ad Run on This Site Shown Above**" src="https://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2021/10/wordads-ad-1.png?w=877" />
<p class="caption"><strong>Example Ad Run on This Site Shown Above</strong></p>
</div>
<p>In my WordPress account, I upgraded to the business plan. This gave me access to WordPress plug-ins. I enabled the <a class="reference external" href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/">Yoast SEO plug-in</a> and activated its site optimization. I also enabled the maximum ads possible in my settings. In spite of these efforts, the results were sparse. Maybe there's more that I could have done. But this blog is passive and more like a hobby at the moment. I'm ok with a blog that makes $0.86 per month. Maybe someday it will be worth more. But I enjoy writing so it's all good. My skills grow and maybe I share something with someone across the world. That's what keeps me coming back.</p>
<p>I concluded I will not be running ads anytime soon. I wanted to get a baseline of what I was leaving on the table by not running ads. Now I can project when I might tap into the blog's potential traffic revenue, if ever. It seems I would need much higher views per month before ads makes sense with my level of traffic, 65 blog followers and minor social media clout.</p>
<p>There's also the added benefit of not serving up people's data to ad companies. Ads seem to be a generally accepted way to earn from your internet labors. But right now, they're not for this blog. Good luck monetizing your blog. Or just writing for the hell of it!</p>

                <p>Black is a code formatting tool that I have been testing out recently to see what the hype is about. It is the defacto &quot;uncompromising code formatter in Python&quot;. I normally do not use any code formatters since I'm not required to use them. This short post aims to convince you that Black is an insightful way to see the parts of your code that are dangerously unreadable.</p>
<p>I have found it interesting to see what black does with my gnarliest code. It has taught me what is considered &quot;good formatting&quot; by some Pythonistas. The areas where I see the most improvement is how it enforces <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP-8</a>'s characters per line limit. Often before, I didn't know how to break my code into several lines. My scripts tended to have one-liners trailing off the edge of my text editor. Black teaches you new ways to organize your code and makes it easier to understand. Now I write my code like Black the first time instead of letting it trail off the screen.</p>
<p>Initially I was hesitant to try Black because I didn't want to sabotage my own code style. But since running Black on a few of my scripts, it has taught me new ways to write code. Give Black a chance and you will learn how to write more readable Python.</p>

<p>Write code everyday. Code fast and break things. Cherish your tracebacks. Keep going back, no matter how hopeless it may seem. Code habitually. Learn how to code. Get better at code. Love code.</p>
<p><strong>Write Less Code</strong></p>
<p>Use as few lines as possible. Nothing looks better than a program shorter than 50 or 100 lines! Avoid aggressively gnarly one-liners. Use sensible one-liners or [<em>gasp</em>] for loops. Read other people's code.</p>
<p>Write more code, write less code.</p>

                <p>A static site generator creates static HTML and markdown files to serve as a website. They're commonly used to host blogs but not exclusively. I recently researched my options to roll a static site in Python. I'm assessing a few of them as a potential future self-hosted blogging solution for this Wordpress blog. Or maybe I'll spin up a new one!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why Statics?</strong></p>
<p>Most &quot;modern&quot; websites are <em>dynamic</em> in the sense that the contents of the site live in a database, and are converted into presentation-ready HTML only when a user wants to see the page. That's great. However, it presents some minor issues that static site generators try to solve.</p>
<p>In a static site, the whole site, every page, <em>everything</em>, is created before the first user even sees it and uploaded to the server as a simple folder full of HTML files (and images, CSS, etc).</p>

                <p>I initially installed my Python version from the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-39/9p7qfqmjrfp7">Windows Store</a> and it worked fine for almost a year on my Windows 10 computer. Then I started getting this error message when trying to use the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/advanced/#ssl-cert-verification">requests library</a> on all HTTP requests:</p>

<p>Apparently my Python certificates were not valid or up to date on my computer. These are &quot;.PEM&quot; or &quot;.cert&quot; files that certify your connection for the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ssl.com/faqs/faq-what-is-ssl/">SSL protocol</a>. I googled this error until I found the <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/python-certifi-win32/">python-certifi-win32</a> library. I only needed to <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/01/20/how-to-python-pip-install-new-libraries/">pip install</a> this library and it fixed the problem:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">pip install <span class="pre">python-certifi-win32</span></tt></p>
<p>Huge thank you to <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/user/andrewleech/">the maintainer</a> of this package. It solved my issues and now I can make HTTP requests again!</p>

                <p>You read the whole thing front to back? Every word? Stop and think about it. What is the computer trying to tell you?</p>
<p>Sometimes something is obvious but needs to be reminded. I found myself thinking this yet again today. Often there are times where I would have saved some time and grief by carefully reading the error.</p>
<p>Carefully read the error when you see a traceback. Then once you've taken it all in, consider what to do next. If you're stumped, googling it might yield a solution. But make sure you actually read the error first.</p>

                <p>After 12 years with Gmail as my primary email inbox, I wanted to clear out old &quot;Promotions&quot; emails. This can be done with some clever use of Gmail's search syntax shown below.</p>
<p>I wanted to preserve my &quot;Starred&quot; emails, but delete old emails to free up space. I was able to delete 58,000 &quot;Promotions&quot; emails! I wrote this post because I feel it might save you a little time figuring it out yourself. I also included brief details on possible Python tools for Gmail and IMAP below if you are considering scripting your contact management.</p>
<p>I didn't need Python in the end after reading some <a class="reference external" href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en">Gmail search operator examples</a>. For example, adding a hypen before a search in Gmail acts similar to a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#NOT">&quot;bitwise&quot; or unary operator (~)</a> in Python. It excludes or inverses the criteria in a search rather than including it. I was able to use this to exclude my starred emails. You can also add a filter for &quot;has attachment&quot;. I used that to star any emails with attachments, then delete the rest and excluded &quot;starred&quot; emails.</p>
<p><strong>Gmail search syntax to get &quot;Promotions&quot; minus &quot;Starred&quot; emails and filter on a date range</strong>:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">category:promotions <span class="pre">-is:starred</span> after:2019/12/31 before:2021/1/1</tt></p>
<p><strong>Selecting &quot;all&quot; emails in your search</strong></p>

<p><strong>Once, you've selected &quot;All&quot; from the checkbox dropdown, click &quot;Select all conversations that match this search&quot;.</strong> Now you can apply actions such as &quot;add a star&quot; or &quot;delete&quot; them by clicking the (⋮) vertical ellipses menu:</p>

</div>
<p><strong>To Python or not?</strong></p>
<p>I also considered Python tools for interfacing with gmail to accomplish this. There doesn't seem to be an easy way to group emails by &quot;Category&quot; in the <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python">Gmail API</a> or IMAP. IMAP is shorthand for <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol">Internet Message Access Protocol</a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/imaplib.html">imaplib</a> is an &quot;IMAP4 protocol client&quot; in the Python standard library. Usually python's <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html">smtplib</a> is the first library that comes up for email. Don't forget about imaplib! It might be more suitable for searching based on text in your emails or <a class="reference external" href="https://superuser.com/questions/719677/how-to-use-gmail-tabs-with-imap">creating labeled segments yourself, then applying actions to them</a>.</p>
