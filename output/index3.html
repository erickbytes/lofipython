                <p>Black is a code formatting tool that I have been testing out recently to see what the hype is about. It is the defacto &quot;uncompromising code formatter in Python&quot;. I normally do not use any code formatters since I'm not required to use them. This short post aims to convince you that Black is an insightful way to see the parts of your code that are dangerously unreadable.</p>
<p>I have found it interesting to see what black does with my gnarliest code. It has taught me what is considered &quot;good formatting&quot; by some Pythonistas. The areas where I see the most improvement is how it enforces <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP-8</a>'s characters per line limit. Often before, I didn't know how to break my code into several lines. My scripts tended to have one-liners trailing off the edge of my text editor. Black teaches you new ways to organize your code and makes it easier to understand. Now I write my code like Black the first time instead of letting it trail off the screen.</p>
<p>Initially I was hesitant to try Black because I didn't want to sabotage my own code style. But since running Black on a few of my scripts, it has taught me new ways to write code. Give Black a chance and you will learn how to write more readable Python.</p>
<p>Here's the project on GitHub: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psf/black">https://github.com/psf/black</a></p>

                <p><strong>Write More Code</strong></p>
<p>Write code everyday. Code fast and break things. Cherish your tracebacks. Keep going back, no matter how hopeless it may seem. Code habitually. Learn how to code. Get better at code. Love code.</p>
<p><strong>Write Less Code</strong></p>
<p>Use as few lines as possible. Nothing looks better than a program shorter than 50 or 100 lines! Avoid aggressively gnarly one-liners. Use sensible one-liners or [<em>gasp</em>] for loops. Read other people's code.</p>
<p>Write more code, write less code.</p>

                <p>A static site generator creates static HTML and markdown files to serve as a website. They're commonly used to host blogs but not exclusively. I recently researched my options to roll a static site in Python. I'm assessing a few of them as a potential future self-hosted blogging solution for this Wordpress blog. Or maybe I'll spin up a new one!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why Statics?</strong></p>
<p>Most &quot;modern&quot; websites are <em>dynamic</em> in the sense that the contents of the site live in a database, and are converted into presentation-ready HTML only when a user wants to see the page. That's great. However, it presents some minor issues that static site generators try to solve.</p>
<p>In a static site, the whole site, every page, <em>everything</em>, is created before the first user even sees it and uploaded to the server as a simple folder full of HTML files (and images, CSS, etc).</p>

                <p>Hi,</p>
<p>These days, starting a business is so easy that it has become a great option for a side gig.</p>
<p>Ecommerce businesses, especially, are great for anyone who wants to test the entrepreneurial waters or set up a potential passive income stream. But as with any business, the key to success in ecommerce is creating loyal, happy customers.</p>
<p>It’s a topic I’d love to write about for your website, if you’re interested. In the article, I’ll offer tips for ecommerce entrepreneurs or wannabe entrepreneurs on how they can attract first-time customers and turn them into loyal shoppers. I'll include a tip on hiring a web designer to put together an attractive, easy-to-navigate website, and will plug in your services.</p>
<p>Please let me know if this topic is of interest and I’ll get started on the article.</p>

                <p>Today I scoured the internet for tools written in Python that assist writing in any form. After some relentless Google and Github searching, here are my favorites.

                <p>You read the whole thing front to back? Every word? Stop and think about it. What is the computer trying to tell you?</p>
<p>Sometimes something is obvious but needs to be reminded. I found myself thinking this yet again today. Often there are times where I would have saved some time and grief by carefully reading the error.</p>
<p>Carefully read the error when you see a traceback. Then once you've taken it all in, consider what to do next. If you're stumped, googling it might yield a solution. But make sure you actually read the error first.</p>

                <p>After 12 years with Gmail as my primary email inbox, I wanted to clear out old &quot;Promotions&quot; emails. This can be done with some clever use of Gmail's search syntax shown below.</p>
<p>I wanted to preserve my &quot;Starred&quot; emails, but delete old emails to free up space. I was able to delete 58,000 &quot;Promotions&quot; emails! I wrote this post because I feel it might save you a little time figuring it out yourself. I also included brief details on possible Python tools for Gmail and IMAP below if you are considering scripting your contact management.</p>
<p>I didn't need Python in the end after reading some <a class="reference external" href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en">Gmail search operator examples</a>. For example, adding a hypen before a search in Gmail acts similar to a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#NOT">&quot;bitwise&quot; or unary operator (~)</a> in Python. It excludes or inverses the criteria in a search rather than including it. I was able to use this to exclude my starred emails. You can also add a filter for &quot;has attachment&quot;. I used that to star any emails with attachments, then delete the rest and excluded &quot;starred&quot; emails.</p>
<p><strong>Gmail search syntax to get &quot;Promotions&quot; minus &quot;Starred&quot; emails and filter on a date range</strong>:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">category:promotions <span class="pre">-is:starred</span> after:2019/12/31 before:2021/1/1</tt></p>
<p><strong>Selecting &quot;all&quot; emails in your search</strong></p>

<img alt="" src="https://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/select-all-in-search.jpg?w=588" />
</div>
<p><strong>Once, you've selected &quot;All&quot; from the checkbox dropdown, click &quot;Select all conversations that match this search&quot;.</strong> Now you can apply actions such as &quot;add a star&quot; or &quot;delete&quot; them by clicking the (⋮) vertical ellipses menu:</p>

</div>
<p><strong>To Python or not?</strong></p>
<p>I also considered Python tools for interfacing with gmail to accomplish this. There doesn't seem to be an easy way to group emails by &quot;Category&quot; in the <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python">Gmail API</a> or IMAP. IMAP is shorthand for <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol">Internet Message Access Protocol</a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/imaplib.html">imaplib</a> is an &quot;IMAP4 protocol client&quot; in the Python standard library. Usually python's <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html">smtplib</a> is the first library that comes up for email. Don't forget about imaplib! It might be more suitable for searching based on text in your emails or <a class="reference external" href="https://superuser.com/questions/719677/how-to-use-gmail-tabs-with-imap">creating labeled segments yourself, then applying actions to them</a>.</p>

                <p>Your life is a game of trade-offs. You spend x units of energy on x thing in order to gain something from it. You only have a limited number of energy and focus units.</p>
<p><strong>Each life interest you pursue comes with a cost per benefit units returned. Some examples of this might be:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>cooking vs. ordering food</li>
<li>family life, relationship, friends &amp; social life</li>
<li>job, income, career, financial planning</li>
<li>travel \ serendipity</li>
<li>skill development \ hobbies</li>
<li>home improvement \ DIY vs. hiring specialists</li>
<li>health choices \ exercising frequency</li>
<li>renting vs. buying a house</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these life choices require a certain amount of your energy and focus. So how do you determine the right balance?</p>
<p>It's good to start from the idea that nothing is given that you have to have. Some people eat take-out food instead of cooking. Lately I've preferred this as well. I know how to cook some things. But I know I can outsource the meal, pay a premium and enjoy great food. I am able to support my cravings for Taqueria Traspasada, even if it is more expensive. I want to leverage this trade-off to get a meal from someone who is a better cook than me. I also like supporting local businesses. All I have to do is pick it up from the restaurant. Plus it saves me the time spent shopping and preparing the meal, which I can use to write blog posts! 🤓 Or instead use the time to learn to speak German and French. J'habit a Chicago a Logan Square 👋</p>
<p>Some humans have no interest in seeing their family. Others are very tightly woven into the fabric of their kin. Introverts and extroverts will fall over the spectrum in what they deem an adequate social life. (But we're all pretty much even on this front in this pandemic world it seems.) Ultimately time given to others could be invested in yourself. However, humans are social animals and we benefit greatly from our bonds with our friends and family.</p>
<p>My point is that you should not assume that you have to be a good cook. But cooking is a rewarding and useful habit to cultivate. Maybe someday I'll get back into it more regularly!</p>
<p>You should pursue home improvement and DIY if it is interesting and fun to you. But I will hire a contractor if I ever need any work done on my home and leverage their specialization. Actually, I've avoided this choice altogether by renting an apartment instead of buying a house. I don't plan on buying a home anytime soon. That's my preference in this trade-off.</p>
<p>Renting instead of buying is also more conducive to my yearning for serendipity, which is a life more mobile and free with less rigid or even no employment. But right now I am greatly benefiting from stable employment with a successful company. Less vacation now is a trade for financial stability. But maybe someday I'll have both? Either way, someday I'll backpack the world. 🌍🌏🌎</p>
<p><strong>Relevant Economic Theory: The Law of Diminishing</strong><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility">Marginal Utility</a></p>
<p>In college, my economics professor likened this law to eating <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac">Big Macs</a> from McDonald's. The first Big Mac you eat gives you the most happiness units. The 2nd Big Mac gives you some happiness, but less than the first one because you are full. A 3rd Big Mac would give you even less happiness units. Hopefully you don't eat more than 3 Big Macs in one sitting, it won't give you very many happiness units. 😆</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Law Of Diminishing Marginal Utility states that all else equal as consumption increases the marginal utility derived from each additional unit declines. Marginal utility is derived as the change in&nbsp;utility&nbsp;as an additional unit is consumed. Utility is an economic term used to represent satisfaction or happiness.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When allocating your energy and focus units, keep in mind this law. Maybe going out with your friends more than once a week gives you diminishing marginal utility. Maybe those units will be better spent on other activities and will bring greater joy per energy unit spent.</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion,</strong> carefully consider all of these trade-offs when designing your ideal life. Be cautious of putting too much of your energy and focus units into any one of these. But there's no right or wrong balance. The key is to think about your preferences, seek them out and constantly re-evaluate your trade-off decisions. Consider deeply what you really want and run towards it.</p>
