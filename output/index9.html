                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Four years ago, I began studying Python as my first programming language. I have enjoyed it so much. I now enjoy going to work and writing Python scripts for up to 60% of a typical work day. I love the language. I've also dabbled in JavaScript, CSS and HTML, but have only applied those to make simple, minimum viable websites. So why learn another language, Rust?</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Learning multiple languages enhances one's understanding of computing.</strong> All languages tackle the same problems in different ways. Some leverage trade-offs enabling them to better solve specific computing problems than others. Seeing different approaches to the same challenges increases your understanding of the concepts.</li>
<li><strong>Rust is beloved by its developers.</strong> It scored highly on <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019">Stack Overflow's 2019 developer survey</a>. The most loved language was Rust, with 83.5% of developers saying they loved it. Python was tied for 2nd at 73.1% with TypeScript.</li>
<li><strong>Rust is an LLVM language, Python is not.</strong> Per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM">Wikipedia</a>, "The LLVM <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler" title="Compiler">compiler</a> infrastructure project is a set of compiler and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolchain" title="Toolchain">toolchain</a> technologies, which can be used to develop a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler#Front_end" title="Compiler">front end</a> for any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language" title="Programming language">programming language</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler#Back_end" title="Compiler">back end</a> for any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture" title="Instruction set architecture">instruction set architecture</a>." It seems Rust opens up modularity to mesh with a bunch of other LLVM languages. Side note: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM">LLVM started</a> at my alma mater, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign 😃 ILL 🔶🔷</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>LLVM was originally developed as a research infrastructure to investigate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_compilation" title="Dynamic compilation">dynamic compilation</a> techniques for static and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language" title="Dynamic programming language">dynamic</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language" title="Programming language">programming languages</a>. -<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rust plays well with WebAssembly.</strong> AKA <a href="https://webassembly.org/">Wasm</a>, a new standard introduced in 2015 that allows compilation of high performance browser or Desktop applications. I am still grappling with why Wasm is getting so much hype, but it seems to be a big deal. Rust opens doors to Wasm compatibility. Python is Wasm capable as well but I am getting the impression there is something in Rust's design that makes it useful for compiling to Wasm.</li>
<li><strong>It is a modern language, which surfaced in 2010, that is still coming of age.</strong> This is both good and bad. But the good here is modern language design. Its creator saw the shortcomings of countless languages that have come before it. An enthusiastic community has already made Rust a good programming language option in a short time.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Getting Started with Rust</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started">Getting Started</a> page contains a simple curl command for downloading and installing Rust via "Rustup", an installer and version management tool. This will install Cargo, Rust's package manager. (Think pip for Pythonistas.) I used my Linux environment on my Chromebook, but there's a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html">Windows executable</a> available as well.</p>

<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html">The Cargo Book</a> provides documentation for the package manager. I like the "<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/first-steps.html">First Steps with Cargo</a>" section because it gets you immediately into creating and running a "build" by entering a few short commands in the terminal.</p>
<p><strong>Create a New Build</strong><br>

<p><strong>cd Into Your hello_world Program</strong></p>
<p>Note the creation of a .toml manifest, and simple Rust program that prints "Hello, world!".</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Yesterday, I converted an 11-year old Dell Inspiron E1505 from Windows XP to Debian 9 Stretch. I may have overwrote my Windows XP OS. I do not care if I lost it since it's a vulnerable and outdated OS, which is no longer supported by Microsoft. I encountered difficulty with getting the wifi to work on Debian, but was able to find a solution using <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WICD">Wicd</a>. Here are the steps I followed to do it all.</p>
<h2>Using The Debian Installer-Loader</h2>
<ol>
<li>First, back up your Windows computer files. Then download the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Loader">Debian-Installer Loader</a> Windows executable from the Debian wiki.</li>
<li>Click the downloaded executable and <img alt="IMG_20190423_184816999" class="wp-image-1785 alignright" height="196" src="http://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/97878-img_20190423_184816999-e1556211269262.jpg" width="311">follow instructions. I followed the default settings all the way through.</li>
<li>You may need to choose your own partitioning settings to ensure Windows is preserved if desired.</li>
<li>During installation, choose your Linux collection. I chose Xfce because it <a href="https://www.slant.co/versus/1122/1124/~xfce_vs_gnome-3">seems to be highest ranked</a> among Linux users and "not just helpful for older computers where few system resources are available, but also simply for those who want to get the most out of their systems." Gnome and KDE are other popular options.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="IMG_20190423_184023738" class="wp-image-1784 aligncenter" height="375" src="http://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2019/04/46248-img_20190423_184023738-e1556211291659.jpg" width="564"></p>
<p><strong>After completing installation, restart your computer and select your new OS on boot-up. The following error codes displayed for me while starting up, signaling missing wifi firmware. </strong>[<br>
ERROR Failed to load firmware!<br>
b43ssb0:0: firmware: failed to load b43/ucode5.fw (-2)<br>
b43ssb0:0: firmware: failed to load b43-open/ucode5.fw (-2)<br>
b43-phy0 ERROR: You must go to https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/b43#devicefirmware and download the correct firmware for this driver version.]{style="font-size:8pt;"}</p>
<p><em>It took me a few boot-ups before I realized what this error message meant. In the rest of this post I am trying to figure out and fix what is wrong before I saw the error message. I enjoyed learning how to introspect Linux networks, but if I were trying to fix this problem again, I'd go to directly to <a href="http://linuxwireless.sipsolutions.net/en/users/Drivers/b43/">this page</a>, which is linked to from the link in the error message, and try the solution there first.</em></p>
<h2>Post Installation Setup</h2>
<p><strong>Open up the terminal once you're into your new Desktop OS</strong> and enter the below commands.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>su - 
apt-get install sudo -y usermod -aG sudo yourusername
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>1) Enable yourself as root user.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) Install sudo.</strong></p>
<p>**3) Give yourself sudo user permissions. **</p>
<h2>Optional: Replacing Network-Manager With Wicd</h2>
<p>This Debian 9 package ships with Network-Manager. After logging in, I wasn't sure why wifi was not working, so I decided to remove Network-Manager and install Wicd. (This was before I realized what the error code displayed on boot-up meant.) Wicd is a Linux network managing alternative and it's built with Python, by the way. I followed <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WICD">these instructions</a> to execute the below commands.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>uninstall nm
sudo apt-get install -d --reinstall network-manager network-manager-gnome
install wicd
sudo apt-get install wicd-gtk
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>After installing Wicd, my Ethernet connection was not working. This fixed it for me:</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo ifconfig eth0 up
</code></pre></div>

<h2>Troubleshooting Linux Wifi &amp; Inspecting Your System</h2>
<p>Now, let's check for enabled network interfaces. "wlan0" is usually the name of the wireless interface. Does wlan0 show when you enter this command? If not, then you may need to update your wifi firmware. This was the case for me. Below is an output where wlan0 is correctly configured.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo ifconfig
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Check wlan0 is not blocked on kill list.</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo rfkill list all
</code></pre></div>

<p>Some computers have a "kill switch" for wifi. This command lists any blocked interfaces. If it is blocked, <a href="https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2298330">this thread</a> might be useful. If nothing shows when you run this command, or if you see wlan0 is not blocked, carry on.</p>
<p><strong>Check which wifi controller you have.</strong> <strong><a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/55868/installing-broadcom-wireless-drivers">This thread</a></strong> <strong>provides more info on what this means.</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>lspci -nn | grep -e 0200 -e 0280

<p><strong>Find your system architecture. This determines which firmware you should download in the next step.</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo dpkg --print-architecture
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>First,</strong> <strong><a href="https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/b43/firmware">read here</a></strong> **to determine the right packages for your Linux system. Then download the appropriate missing wifi firmware. For Debian, I downloaded the two packages below. **</p>
<p>1) <a href="https://packages.debian.org/stretch/b43-fwcutter">b43-fwcutter</a>    2) <a href="https://packages.debian.org/stretch/firmware-b43-installer">b43-installer</a></p>
<p><strong>"cd" into the directory with .deb files. Run the below commands to install the new firmware, then reboot your computer. The last two commands are adapted from</strong> <strong><a href="https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2203312&amp;page=4">this thread</a></strong>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo dpkg -i firmware-b43-installer_019-3_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i firmware-b43-fwcutter_019-3_i386.deb
sudo modprobe -r b43
sudo modprobe b43
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Edit Wicd preferences to set wlan0 as the wireless interface if needed.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Success! Wireless networks are now showing.<br>

<p><strong>Wrapping Up</strong></p>
<p>I'd like to thank the awesome people who contributed to the Debian Installer-loader and all the help in Linux forums that enabled me figure this out. I'm new to the world of Linux but already enjoying diving into this operating system. Its ability to do just about anything from the command line are a lot of fun. I am now running two Linux systems, one on my Dell and another running Ubuntu that I installed on a Chromebook with <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/162120/how-to-install-ubuntu-linux-on-your-chromebook-with-crouton/">Crouton</a>. Both have been relatively painless to set up. It this case, it turned a sluggish laptop into a very capable machine. They should call it Lit-nux :)</p>
<p>https://twitter.com/erickbytes/status/1120864722855825409</p>
<p><strong>Full Disclosure</strong></p>
<p>This worked on my computer for a few days before the keyboard stopped working correctly on my computer. Typing became impossible because the keys didn't work or entered the wrong letters when pressed. I'm not sure what the cause of it was, but consider that before attempting this on a machine. Be prepared to lose it. If you really need the machine to be functional, it may not be a great idea to try this. This was attempted on an old beat up computer. I would try this method of porting a Windows machine to Linux again as a salvage project or on a low-risk Windows machine if I had one lying around.</p>

<h2>Installation and Startup</h2>
<p>**New to Jupyter, pandas or pip? **</p>
<p>Welcome to the club. If you need a run-down on using pip, I wrote <a href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/01/20/how-to-python-pip-install-new-libraries/">this post</a> to help sort it out. If you want a superb, gentle and funny introduction to pandas, Jupyter, and data analysis, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JnMutdy6Fw">this PyCon session</a> is the best tutorial I have found, by far.</p>
<p><strong>To run the scripts shown in this post, you must:</strong> (1) install the three libraries below to run in a Jupyter notebook (recommended) <strong>OR</strong> (2) run these plots from the command line and view them as a saved image. To do that, just install pandas and matplotlib.</p>
<p><strong>First, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html">install libraries with pip</a>. Enter in command prompt or terminal:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>python -m pip install pandas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>python -m pip install matplotlib</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>python3 -m pip install jupyter</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Then, run Jupyter Notebook</strong></p>

<p><em>Note the spikes in tickets per day in 2016 and 2017, and the amount of tickets issued in 2016.  Less tickets were issued in 2017 and 2018, after more allegations surfaced about this troublesome red light camera program.

<p><strong>Chicago's Shady Red Light Camera Program</strong></p>
<p>[2,573,339 violations occurred from July 2014 - March 2019. Personally, I was issued 3 red light camera tickets over the last 5 years. I charted out the tickets by year, month and day.  ]{style="color:var(--color-neutral-600);"}[The below code was used for the left image above, in which I plotted each day of red light camera violations in Chicago over the past 5 years.]{style="color:var(--color-neutral-600);"}</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> We can see 2016 is the leader for the past 5 years in amount of violations that occurred. The city of Chicago has drawn criticism for unethical practices in its camera program to reap more revenue. In 2017, the city approved a settlement of "nearly \$40 million after a previous class-action lawsuit alleged that the program had violated 1.2 million motorists’ due process rights." (<a href="https://www.illinoispolicy.org/lawsuit-claims-chicago-red-light-cameras-violate-state-law/">Source</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A Tribune analysis of more than 4 million tickets issued since 2007 and a deeper probe of individual cases reveal clear evidence that a series of sudden, unexplainable spikes in Chicago's network of 380 cameras were caused by faulty equipment, human tinkering or both. Chicago transportation officials say they had no knowledge of the wild swings in ticketing until they were told by the Tribune — even though City Hall legally required the camera vendor to watch for the slightest anomaly in ticketing patterns every day. Many of the spikes lasted weeks." (<a href="http://graphics.chicagotribune.com/news/local/red-light-timeline/">Source</a>)</p>

<p>This USDA data was updated in 2015. It provides many common foods and their nutrient levels, such as carbohydrates and iron, for breads, fruits, vegetables, beverages and most foods you can find in a grocery store.

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> It's strange to think that these common jobs, which currently make up a large portion of our economy, will likely be computerised some day. They all seem to be entry-level manual tasks. The promise of automation is that it frees humans up to focus on more meaningful or complex problems. How will the 125,000 cashiers in Illinois adapt when that is no longer a way to earn money?</p>

<p><strong>The Plot Thickens...</strong></p>
<p>I've barely scratched the surface in my experience with datasets, but already found some very interesting data to inspect and play with. These data visualization skills are adaptable to many situations. All you need is good data to bring to life. Stay curious, my friends.</p>

                <p>You may or may not be familiar with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsX05-2sVSH7Nx3zuk3NYuQ">PyCon</a>'s <a href="https://pyvideo.org/pycon-us-2010/pycon-2010--plenary--saturday-evening-lightning-t.html">Lightning Talks</a>, a session of quick hitter talks given each year on a variety of topics. These "Lightning Scripts" are ten of my favorite Python scripts that have served me well as of late to perform a variety of tasks.</p>
<p>Highlights include the glob, os, calendar, webbrowser and pandas modules. Plus, how to convert a dataframe into a pdf and how to take a snapshot of a website with pdfkit. The webpage pdf was not the greatest snapshot in some cases, but did capture text and many of a live website's visual elements.</p>
<p>If you have Python installed, paste the script into a text editor and run your .py file from the command line or however you like to run your scripts. You may have to change file paths to work on your operating system.</p>
<h2>The first 5 scripts use modules that ship with Python.</h2>

<h2>To Run The Last Two Scripts, install pdfkit:</h2>
<p>pdfkit relies on another library, wkhtmltopdf, which adds an extra wrinkle to setting it up for Windows users. I've laid out the differences between using pdfkit for Windows vs. Ubuntu below.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>python -m pip install pdfkit
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>installing wkhtmltopdf on Windows</strong></p>
<p>To use pdfkit on Windows, go to the link, choose your version to download. This installs a Windows executable that pdfkit needs to find to work.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">https</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="o">//</span><span class="n">wkhtmltopdf</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">org</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">downloads</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">html</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>installing wkhtmltopdf on Ubuntu</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>sudo apt-get install wkhtmltopdf

<p>⚡ <strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>I am very pleased with pdfkit. I am also toying around with Python's <a href="https://pyfpdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">PyFPDF</a> and <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/PyPDF2/">PyPDF2</a> libraries. Together, these three offer some unique abilities for creating and manipulating pdf files. And the pandas library is amazing for reading and writing tabular data sheets, can't say enough great things about pandas. Worth the time. Hope you enjoyed these Lightning Scripts :) **⚡ **</p>

                <p>**In painting and coding, there are no mistakes, only happy accidents. **</p>
<p>Fortunately when errors happen, Python affords us its stock '<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html">logging</a>' module, which sometimes catches flak in the community for its syntax and documentation. After poking around this module, I've found it quite suitable to my needs. Thanks to the logging module, I'm catching my happy coding accidents and fixing them like a pro.</p>
<p><strong>Below is my simple logging setup, which I am using to monitor <a href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/11/25/automated-python-with-windows-task-scheduler/">automated Python scripts</a>.</strong> <strong>This script is a "painting" program created to demonstrate logging. </strong>Passing the below to the basicConfig() format argument logs a timestamp, effective for tracking the time of errors. This example logs the error and the traceback to a .log file.</p>

<p><strong>Below is an example of logging only the error, without a traceback. </strong>I am still learning when each is appropriate, but I've found this exception handling variation useful when logging lots of errors that are acceptable and expected in my try/except loops. Note also that in this variation, I have changed the level argument to logging.DEBUG. This mode offers more program execution details to help debug an error when needed.</p>

<p><strong>Result: writing errors to a .log file.</strong><br>
You should see that Python has created a fresh .log file with your happy little errors. Below is an example log from a tabular data cleaning program I wrote. The single line errors were produced using the second "Exception as e" method. At the bottom, we can see the full traceback, produced by the first, "logging.exception" method. This .log file resulted from passing the level=logging.INFO argument.</p>
<p><strong>Example .log output file:</strong></p>

<p><strong>What's the difference between a .log file and a .txt file?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference between the two file types is that <a href="https://pc.net/extensions/file/log">.LOG</a> files are typically generated automatically, while <a href="https://pc.net/extensions/file/txt">.TXT</a> files are created by the user.  <strong>- pc.net</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>
<p>I will continue to explore logging methods but this seems to sufficiently log my program activity and errors. Now, my favorite part of work is peeking in on the logs to see how my happy little Python programs are running.</p>

<p>It's worth mentioning there are alternative, external logging libraries to Python's default logging library. <em>Do whatever makes you happy</em>, just make sure you are logging somehow, especially if you have <a href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/11/25/automated-python-with-windows-task-scheduler/">automated your Python programs</a> and want to monitor them. This method has worked for me as someone who previously had no experience whatsoever at logging program error activity. Thank you for reading and enjoying the joy of logging. :)</p>

                    <a href="https://pythonmarketer.com/automated-python-with-windows-task-scheduler.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to &quot;Automated Python With Windows Task Scheduler&quot;">Automated Python With Windows Task Scheduler</a>
                </h2>

                
                

                <p><strong>So you want to run your Python scripts automatically, but how?</strong></p>
<p>I had heard of several popular scheduling libraries in Python like <a href="http://www.celeryproject.org/">celery</a>, <a href="https://www.pyinvoke.org/">Invoke</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/dbader/schedule">schedule</a>. One of my requirements is to run the python file "in the background", not in command prompt or an open window.</p>
<p>Enter Windows Task Scheduler, the de facto scheduler on Windows 7 computers. I have  scheduled a few scripts and it is working like a charm. In this post, I will schedule an example script to clean up my desktop at the beginning of each day. I have a habit of accumulating many Excel files there throughout the workday. This example automatically moves them into a folder.</p>
<p>Other Windows scheduling alternatives worth mentioning include <a href="http://thepythoncorner.com/dev/how-to-create-a-windows-service-in-python/">creating a Windows service</a>, or using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/taskschd/schtasks">schtasks</a> if you prefer the command line.</p>
<p><strong>Here's how to schedule a Python script to run:</strong></p>
<p>1. Search for Windows Task Scheduler in the start menu. Then select "Task Scheduler Library" to see all of the tasks Windows is running automatically.</p>
<p>2. In the right toolbar, select "Create Basic Task" and give it a name and description. Note: I selected "Configure for: Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2".</p>
<p><img alt="general" class="wp-image-1577 alignright" height="361" src="https://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/general.png" width="481"></p>
<p>3. Set the time and frequency that the program will run in the "Triggers" tab.</p>
<p>4. Under the "Actions" tab, select "Start a Program" from the dropdown. Under "Program/Script", enter the path to your Python.exe file. I set mine to a Python executable located within my <a href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/04/10/creating-isolated-python-environments-with-virtualenv/">virtual environment</a>, but yours might be found wherever you have Python installed.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>C:\Users\your_username\Desktop\36env\Scripts\python.exe
</code></pre></div>

<p>5. Under "Add arguments (optional)", add the path to your .py script, within quotes:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>&quot;C:\Users\your_username\Desktop\36env\clean_desktop_excels.py&quot;
</code></pre></div>

<p><img alt="actions" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1578" height="236" src="http://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/bd0a9-actions-e1543177551739.png" width="448"></p>
<p>6. Select additional conditions and settings as desired, such as "Wake the computer to run this task" and "Run with highest privileges".</p>
<p>I am enjoying this simple, easy and convenient scheduling manager for Windows. I figured most of this out thanks to <a href="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/product/analytics/scheduling-a-python-script-or-model-to-run-at-a-prescribed-time/?rmedium=redirect&amp;rsource=/esri/arcgis/2013/07/30/scheduling-a-scrip">this blog</a>. Below is my script to clean my desktop each morning by moving my Excel files into a folder, using Python's stock <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html">shutil</a> and os libraries. Set it and forget it, ya know what i mean? :D</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>My research found that for creating a single-file Windows executable from a .py file, the front-running Python library is Pyinstaller. It worked on my Windows 7 PC. My program used a <a href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/08/25/gooey-gui-for-python-scripts/">Gooey GUI</a>, but many of the popular Python GUI libraries work as well.</p>
<p><strong>Installation:</strong></p>
<p>To install, enter this into command your command prompt or terminal:<br>
<code>python -m pip install pyinstaller</code>  </p>
<p><em>At the time of this article, this installed Pyinstaller version 3.3.1 using Python version 3.6.5. <a href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/01/20/how-to-python-pip-install-new-libraries/">Go here</a> for a refresher on setting up pip if you need it.</em></p>
<p><strong>Using the build.spec file and starting Pyinstaller:</strong></p>
<p>Most examples I found used a build.spec file. Think of this as the blueprint by which your app will be constructed. It provides the compiling settings, images and any other data necessary for assembling your app.  The format for passing the .spec file to Pyinstaller in pseudo-code:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>pyinstaller (run mode options) (.spec file)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Basic start compiler command to build.spec:</strong><br>
<code>pyinstaller build.spec</code>  </p>
<p><strong>Establishing a debugging loop with Pyinstaller:</strong></p>
<p>Debug mode can be set from the command line:<br>
<code>pyinstaller -debug build.spec</code>  </p>
<p><strong>OR</strong> by passing debug=True to the EXE() function of the build.spec.<em> I used the second option. See my full build.spec file at the bottom of this post. Pyinstaller displayed a lot of error messages while compiling my app, but it still compiled into a working .exe.</em></p>
<p><em>To see your app's error message, run the resulting your_app.exe from the command line. </em>You can find it in the 'dist' folder that pyinstaller creates when you pass it the build.spec file. Set the dist folder as your working directory, type your_app.exe and hit enter. Once you are reading and fixing error messages, you're well on the way to creating your own desktop app.</p>
<p><strong>Flushing sys.stdout/Python printing for Windows:</strong></p>
<p>Python's design requires some code to play nice with Windows when it prints a statement. Simply add this to your .py file. I used write mode 'w'. What worked for me: don't pass 0 to fdopen(). This was contrary to <a href="http://chriskiehl.com/article/packaging-gooey-with-pyinstaller/">Gooey's instructions</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Fetching the local user's system information:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Adding library-specific patches:</strong></p>
<p>1. Below is the <a href="https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/3422">fix</a> I found for the Pandas library, which I added to my build.spec:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>hiddenimports=[&#39;pandas._libs.tslibs.timedeltas&#39;,&#39;pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype&#39;,
&#39;pandas._libs.tslibs.np_datetime&#39;,&#39;pandas._libs.skiplist&#39;]
</code></pre></div>

<p>2. The Gooey library needs some special code added to the build.spec for its images and languages data. More details are found in this <a href="http://chriskiehl.com/article/packaging-gooey-with-pyinstaller/">blog post</a>, written by the author of the Gooey library.</p>

<p><strong>Last, but not least: don't panic.</strong></p>
<p>Compiling Python to Windows binary code sounds like a daunting [task, but it wasn't nearly as complex as I feared. The folks behind Pyinstaller have done a great job of making it possible and, dare I say, simple. Stay calm, drink some coffee, dig in and welcome the challenge with a trial and error mentality. I was able to figure it out over the span of one Saturday. Good luck.]{style="line-height:inherit;"}</p>

<p><strong>Caveats:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You should compile the program on the operating system it will be run on. There are options for creating a multi-os compatible package, but I did not attempt them.</li>
<li>Windows 7 is proven to work with Pyinstaller, per the documentation. It's also what I am running on. Other Windows systems older than Windows 10 may be less reliable.</li>
<li>I experienced trouble when passing arguments from the command line to pyinstaller and have so far been unable to get the console window to hide. Neither the -w, --windowed, --noconsole arguments seemed to work. I will update if I am able to find a solution.</li>
<li>Now that I am testing my compiled app, I am seeing 10x performance slowdowns when running as the final .exe vs. the original .py file. But at least the program runs correctly and still does so relatively quickly.</li>
<li>I also received the error: "Fatal error: Pyinstaller does not include a pre-compiled bootloader for your platform." I fixed this by upgrading to the latest version of Pyinstaller: <code>pip3 install --upgrade pyinstaller</code></li>

<p>/rəˈɡreSH(ə)n<br>
<em>noun</em><br>
1. a return to a former or less developed state.<br>
2. <em>STATISTICS</em> a measure of the relation between the mean value of one variable (e.g., output) and corresponding values of other variables (e.g., time and cost).</p>
<p>Regression analysis is commonly cited in the data science community (and science in general), a building block of statistics, and routinely referenced within the rapidly growing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning">machine learning</a> movement. So what is this mysterious math sorcery? Did Isaac Newton use regression analysis? These magical regressions seem important. We shall dig deeper. Here's what I've found, thanks to <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2010/explained-reg-analysis-0316">MIT News</a>, circa 2010:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To grasp the basic concept, take the simplest form of a regression: a linear, bivariate regression, which describes an unchanging relationship between two (and not more) phenomena. Now suppose you are wondering if there is a connection between the time high school students spend doing French homework, and the grades they receive. These types of data can be plotted as points on a graph, where the x-axis is the average number of hours per week a student studies, and the y-axis represents exam scores out of 100. Together, the data points will typically scatter a bit on the graph. The regression analysis creates the single line that best summarizes the distribution of points.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok, so it's correlationary tool. Sounds useful. Additionally, consider the mathematical  equation representation of regressions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mathematically, the line representing a simple linear regression is expressed through a basic equation: Y = a~0~ + a~1~ X. Here X is hours spent studying per week, the “independent variable.” Y is the exam scores, the “dependent variable,” since — we believe — those scores depend on time spent studying. Additionally, a~0~ is the y-intercept (the value of Y when X is zero) and a~1~ is the slope of the line, characterizing the relationship between the two variables. (<strong><em>source: <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2010/explained-reg-analysis-0316">MIT News)</a></em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Geesh, that's kinda dense. But can we do it with Python? Ah, yes we can. Below is the amassed code from <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html"><em>Towards Data Science</em></a> to run a basic regression that generates predictions from a Boston house values dataset within <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html">sci-kit learn.</a></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html">pip install sklearn</a> and pandas first, by entering in the terminal:</strong></p>

<li>
<p>pip install -U scikit-learn</p>

                <p><strong>Goal:</strong> recreate my resume in the dark Atom text editor theme (background and fonts).<br>
<strong>Sub-goal:</strong> find a color eyedropper to grab the actual color values of the Atom layout.</p>
<p><strong>Approach #1: find an Atom eyedropper package to grab the colors.</strong></p>
<p>My first thought was to find the easiest solution, within the packages of my Atom text editor. After searching Atom's packages, the two best potential solutions were <a href="https://atom.io/packages/an-color-picker">an-color-eyedropper</a> and <a href="https://atom.io/packages/color-picker">color picker</a>. The an-color-eyedropper description sounds perfect: <em>"A simple "real" color picker. By "real" I mean it's able to pick colors anywhere on any screen." </em>Unfortunately it failed to install and displayed the error, "Unable to download 400 Bad Request Repository inaccessible". It seems to rely on the "python" Atom package which is now deprecated (<a href="https://atom.io/packages/script">script</a> is its successor). I was unable to find a repo anywhere by googling.</p>
<p><a href="https://atom.io/packages/color-picker">Color picker</a> has easy-to-follow instructions and installed with no problem. It allows you to quickly select any color visually with sliders. Then the RGB or Hexadecimal values of your color are added as text in the editor in proper format. However, we are looking for a color grabber to pull colors from a screen object. This is more of a productivity enhancing and color exploration tool for programmers. On to Python options.</p>
<p><strong>Approach #2: Use the python tkcolorpicker package to grab the colors.</strong></p>
<p>The first thing I found on Google was <a href="https://pypi.org/project/tkcolorpicker/">tkcolorpicker</a>, a package that uses the <a href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/02/29/tkinter-and-python-libraries/">tkinter</a> library. I couldn't tell exactly what it was, so let's find out. First, install via <a href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/01/20/how-to-python-pip-install-new-libraries/">pip</a>:<br>
<code>python -m pip install tkcolorpicker</code></p>
<p>Then run the below script. Cool gadget for sure, but also not quite what I was looking to use. It allows selection of a color with sliders or input values, similar to Atom's color picker, but for user input rather than color picking. Nice little tool. :D<br>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">tkinter</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="nn">tk</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">tkinter.ttk</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="nn">ttk</span>

<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">hex_code</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">RGB_code</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">root</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mainloop</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>askcolor()</code> returns a tuple with both the RGB and hex codes selected by the user. Above, we are unpacking that tuple into the <code>hex_code</code> and <code>RGB_code</code> variables.</p>
<p><strong>Approach #3: Use the Python eyedropper package to grab the colors.</strong></p>
<p>I then found <a href="https://github.com/umluizlima/eyedropper">eyedropper</a> for Windows, which has a minimalist repository and offers a simple approach to desktop eyedropper functionality. Install eyedropper via <a href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/01/20/how-to-python-pip-install-new-libraries/">pip</a>: <code>python -m pip install eyedropper</code></p>
<p><img alt="pyeyedropper_start" class="size-full wp-image-1458 alignright" height="140" src="https://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/pyeyedropper_start.png" width="239"></p>
<p>Hover your mouse over the object you want to grab the color from (in my case, the Atom text editor background). Then <a href="https://github.com/umluizlima/eyedropper">following these instructions</a>:</p>
<p>Alternatively, I was able to run eyedropper from the command line by entering: <code>py -m eyedropper</code></p>
<p><img alt="pasted_hex2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1461" height="74" src="https://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/pasted_hex2.png" width="766"></p>
<p><img alt="CCvOYFiUgAA4DJd" class="alignright" height="116" src="https://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/ccvoyfiugaa4djd.jpg" width="151"></p>
<p><strong>Mission possible.</strong> Then I hit ctrl+v in a text file and there was the hex code for [my Atom background. Some of the colors that eyedropper grabbed were nearly identical to those in the Atom text editor dark theme. Others were not quite the same. I made slight eyeball adjustments to the colors for some of the fonts. ]{style="color:var(--color-text);"}</p>

<h2>Why not <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29643352/converting-hex-to-rgb-value-in-python">use Python to convert hex to RGB?</a></h2>
<p>Microsoft Word uses RGB codes but eyedropper gave us hex. To convert, I found <a href="https://www.webpagefx.com/web-design/hex-to-rgb/">this website</a> practical and quick.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>GUI stands for "Graphical User Interface", aka the part of a program designed for human interaction. Adding a GUI to a Python script allows anyone to run it without having to code or use the command line.</p>
<p>There are several GUI libraries in Python. A few I have heard of are Tkinter (comes in the standard library), wxPython, PyQT, easygui, <a href="https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui">DearPyGui</a> and PySimpleGUI. I <a href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/02/29/tkinter-and-python-libraries/">explored Tkinter</a> back when I first got into Python. It was more intricate and offered more control over the look of your app, and took longer to pick up. Gooey is more of a pre-packaged GUI library.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey">Gooey Github page</a> was most useful to me and helped me to do what I needed. The script posted <a href="http://pbpython.com/pandas-gui.html">in this blog</a> helped as well. I needed to enable a human to supply three files and enter a number. Gooey was a good match for this. The library has two branches:</p>
<ol>
<li>some basic widgets piggyback off the <a href="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2015/10/08/a-intro-to-argparse/">argparse</a> library</li>
<li>another part of the library uses a function called the GooeyParser. The GooeyParser offers more advanced widgets, like a file chooser. This was exactly what I was looking to use to pull in files for my script.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Installing Gooey</strong></p>
<p>Argparse comes stock with Python. You can install Gooey via the <a href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/01/20/how-to-python-pip-install-new-libraries/">pip installer</a>. Open command prompt or terminal and enter:</p>
<p><code>python -m pip install Gooey</code></p>
<p>Below is a basic argparse/Gooey combination script. The argparse version offers a handful of widgets such as checkboxes and dropdown, but I had trouble getting them to work with the GooeyParser (used in 2nd script).</p>

<p>Side note: Check out Python's <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#vars">vars() built-in</a> function above. It returns the input data as a dictionary called user_inputs. Then we can get the values via the dictionary's keys. Pretty nifty!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The \@Gooey() part of the code is an advanced function known as a <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/">decorator in Python</a>. Put simply, decorators are functions that modify the function to which they are attached.</p>

<p>Overall, Gooey knows what it wants to be, an easy to use GUI framework for Python. It does it well. Here's a screenshot of my program's shiny GUI:</p>
<p><img alt="gooey_gui_shot_2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1431" height="603" src="https://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/gooey_gui_shot_2.png" width="578"></p>
<p>Now that I have a GUI on top of my program and it delivers the expected output file, I'm hoping to take it one step further by packaging it up as a Windows .exe file. This would allow it to run as a desktop app on any Windows computer without the need to install Python or library dependencies. I've only begun exploring options to do this but a few libraries I've heard of are pyinstaller, cx_Freeze and Py2Exe. Updates coming if I figure it out. Cheers :D</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I did figure out how to compile my Gooey app to a Windows application with Pyinstaller. You can <a href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/11/20/packaging-python-as-a-windows-app/">read more on how I did it here</a>.</p>
