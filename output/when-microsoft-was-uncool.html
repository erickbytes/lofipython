                </h2>

                
                

                <p>I began paying attention to what was relevant in the tech scene around 2014, in my 20s.
Back then, I was just getting started studying Python. It was an interesting time in tech.
The term &quot;Big Data&quot; was getting tossed around a lot, but the pandas library hadn't yet reached mass adoption
in data circles like it now has today. People were still talking about Hadoop + Map Reduce. (RIP)</p>
<p>In the 2010s, it didn't take much perusing online to find people in the Python community bashing Microsoft.
If tech companies were a high school, Apple was the cool kid everybody wanted to know, Microsoft was the
kid who nobody liked and everyone made fun of. Understandably, the Windows operating system didn't mesh
with Python programming as well as Linux or Mac OS. By 2024, Microsoft gained their mojo back, or found the mojo
they never had. Having used Windows a lot at my last job, I recognize the OS and its Python implementation have flaws.
I still got my work done and had no problems, without complaining. I continued to play around on Windows and write Python
on it even though people trashed it online. I'm glad I did!</p>
<p>How did Microsoft flip Apple? Steve Ballmer left the company in 2014, yielding to Satya Nadella as CEO.
Since then, the company culture shifted miraculously. In the Python community, they have made a huge impact
by investing in the language. They constantly release free Python + AI courses, and integrated Excel with Python.
Guido, the creator of Python is employed full-time, working on improving the Python language. That tells you a lot
of how much has changed since Python's BDFL is still working there after 3 years. Microsoft's culture change propelled it into
the 2020s with newfound momentum. With some timely bets, they saw the AI revolution coming and capitalized first.</p>
<blockquote>
If someone feels this way in 2024, they probably don't want to admit: Microsoft is Apple in 2012,
and Apple is Microsoft in 2012.</blockquote>
<p>What is funny to see is that nowadays, fewer people are bashing Microsoft. I used to see it regularly,
people teeing off online, &quot;writing Python on Windows is such a terrible experience for XYZ thing, why is Windows so awful??&quot;&quot;
I see less of those people posting such thoughts now. Maybe they're still out there. If someone feels this way in 2024,
they probably don't want to admit: Microsoft is Apple in 2012, and Apple is Microsoft in 2012. I posit they
switched places in respective coolness among tech circles. People realized Apple is not the friend of developers
or society in general. They are self-serving to a vicious degree. Apple is focused on maintaining their walled garden on iOS.</p>
<p>Microsoft is now a better advocate for techies and Python development. Sure, some people prefer to code on Macs,
more power to them. Linux is typically the favorite of the three and it is awesome. It's also not released by a
for profit corporation which is uber cool to developers.</p>
<p>Apple is also less cool due to their battle with Epic Games and insistence on 30% rake for in-app
purchases on iOS. Not to mention an unwillingness to change their policies to appease stricter European Union regulations
for things like 3rd party app stores.</p>
<p>Microsoft is integrating AI deep into their products. Apple, after being slow on the uptake to AI,
followed Microsoft's lead to invest in OpenAI and roll its AI chat to iPhones.
Who is the leader here? In terms of &quot;What have you done for me lately?&quot;, it's Microsoft. In terms of who supports open
and free information, it's Microsoft. Who's cool now?</p>
