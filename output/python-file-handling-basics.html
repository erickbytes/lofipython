                </h2>

                
                

                <p>The basis of many great programs revolve around a simple set of operations:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Open a file.</li>
<li>Do something with the file contents.</li>
<li>Save the new file for the user.</li>
</ol>
<p>Python is nice and simple for this.&nbsp;Paste the below lines into a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=text+editor&amp;oq=text+edit&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.2054j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">text editor</a> and save as a .py file. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki/Python-&amp;-pip-Windows-installation">You need to have Python 3 installed</a>. In the same folder as your .py file, save a .txt file with some words in it. Alright, let's write some code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span>
<span class="normal">2</span>
<span class="normal">3</span>
<span class="normal">4</span>
<span class="normal">5</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><span class="n">file_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Enter your file name. e.g. words.txt&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">file_handle</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">file_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;r&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">lines</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">file_handle</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">readlines</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="nb">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lines</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">file_handle</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">close</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div></td></tr></table></div>
<p>In line 1, we ask the user to enter their file name with Python's raw_input function. When the program runs, the user enters their text file name with extension. This line stores the name in a variable called file_name.</p>
<p><strong>In line 2,</strong> we open your text file and store it in a variable I have named file_handle. Think of the file handle as a bridge between your code and the text file. Quick point about the 'r' above: that tells the program to open the file in &quot;Read&quot; mode. There are several different file modes in programming. Some modes are just for reading an existing file, some are just for writing a new file, and some are capable of both. <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16208206/confused-by-python-file-mode-w/16208298">This Stack Overflow post</a> is well written and details the differences between file modes. Once established, the file handle allows you to read the file's contents or write new contents to the file.</p>
<p><strong>In line 3,</strong>&nbsp;we are calling the .readlines() method on our file handle. This method takes the file contents and stores them, line by line, into a list named &quot;lines&quot;. An alternative method is .read(), which opens the file and stores its contents as one string. Try switching this out in place of&nbsp; .readlines() to check out the difference.</p>
<p><strong>In line 4,</strong> we are printing the stored lines to show them to the user. We now have the file contents, ready to be used however we please.</p>
<p><strong>In line 5</strong>, we are closing the file.</p>
<p>Below, we are going to write a new file using the with statement, which is generally accepted as the best way to read or write a file:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
with open(&quot;Notes.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) as fhand:
    fhand.write(&quot;Did you know whales can live up to 90 years?&quot;)
</pre>
<p>In line 1, we are using Python's input function to ask the user what to name the file and storing it in a variable named file_name.</p>
<p>In line 2,&nbsp; we are calling the open function again that we used in the first example, but this time, notice the &quot;w&quot;. This indicates that we are opening the file in &quot;write&quot; mode.</p>
<p>In line 3, we are calling the .write() method on our file handle, named save_file, and passing it our text to be saved in our new file.</p>
<p><strong>In line 4</strong>, we are closing the file, completing the creation of our new file in the same folder as our .py program file.</p>
<p>Your program is now ready to be run. Double-click your .py file to execute it.</p>
<p>Before learning Python, file operations were a mystery to me. It took me a while to understand this clearly, and I wanted to share. Once you master these basic file operations, programming gets to be a lot more fun. Do try it out for yourself :D</p>
