&lt;p&gt;When I first published the app in 2016, per Google Analytics it had 50 sessions from Google
and over 200 page views in 10 different countries after a few weeks.
In April 2025, the app received 6,749 visits in traffic according to pythonanywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SSL Certificates / Start SSL / PythonAnywhere&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;
An SSL certificate is required for the domain by PythonAnywhere to control the Admin page
and set up your app. You don't need this if your domain is &amp;quot;username.pythonanywhere.com&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was kind of tricky was figuring out how to set up the certificate for the first time.
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/SSLOwnDomains"&gt;These instructions from PythonAnywhere&lt;/a&gt; helped a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a free certificate from Start SSL and it worked fine. If you're new to SSL like me,
here's a simple explanation: you get certificates aka two text files containing a long code
from your SSL provider and submit them to the domain host. The last step is to notify your
domain host and have them verify with the SSL provider. If all goes well, you'll be live in a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Masking&amp;quot; domains&lt;/strong&gt;
This means if you type &amp;quot;google.com&amp;quot;, it will redirect to &amp;quot;www.Google.com&amp;quot; &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.godaddy.com/help/manually-forwarding-or-masking-your-domain-name-422"&gt;GoDaddy makes this super easy&lt;/a&gt;.
I set it up for my site as well. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/NakedDomains"&gt;Here's a post from PythonAnywhere&lt;/a&gt; on this also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborating with other programmers&lt;/strong&gt;
Currently trying to install and run GitHub on my Desktop. It's trickier to do on an outdated operating system.
Another programmer explained to me how it is the base means of collaboration and managing work flow for programmers
working together on a project. Probably will know more about this soon and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://lofipython.com/git-the-basics-a-git-version-control-cheat-sheet/"&gt;write a post on it&lt;/a&gt;.
Git seems awesome and I had not been exposed to this tool until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
