Below are some thoughts that may help you decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your programming goals? Get a coding job? Create an app or website? Become more productive at your current job?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your current experience level? Are you starting fresh or do you already know …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is no one-size-fits-all answer. Below are some thoughts that may help you decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are your programming goals? Get a coding job? Create an app or website? Become more productive at your current job?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your current experience level? Are you starting fresh or do you already know a language or two?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have money saved up? Otherwise, you might need to take out a loan.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A computer science degree is typically most expensive. Coding bootcamps are a lower cost option that pack a wide curriculum
into a few weeks or months, but they can still be pricey. The cheapest option is to take a piecemeal approach through various online courses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;School Advantages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wholistic approach. You get the ins and outs of programming from a proven curriculum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Community. You learn with other students and from experienced teachers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Job placement. Often various schools and bootcamps will connect you to a company.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Credentials. You gain confidence and the backing of your skills by an established institution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Downsides&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuition Money. A lot of what you need to know is available for free or cheap on the web.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Skill level match. Some bootcamps are oriented for beginners, others are more advanced. If you do a bootcamp, make sure it fits your skill level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want a coding job&lt;/strong&gt;, school makes sense. The bootcamps look to be effective if you can
handle the up-front investment. It's possible to land a job without schooling but much tougher.
I am currently considering &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com/"&gt;Full Stack Academy&lt;/a&gt;.
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.codingdojo.com/"&gt;Coding Dojo&lt;/a&gt;. There are many out there. CodeAcademy is a popular route as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to make an app or website&lt;/strong&gt;, the school or the non-school route may both work. For the non-school route, the following languages are good places to start: &lt;em&gt;(note - not a comprehensive list, these are my picks.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web App or Website: HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web App or Website Framework: Flask, Django, py4web, Ruby on Rails, React&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iOS app: Swift plus Apple's Xcode environment, Beeware (python library)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Android App: Java or Kotlin, Beeware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;General Coding: Python or Ruby&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to be more productive at work&lt;/strong&gt;, I recommend learning Python. More on Python and where
to start &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://lofipython.com/marketer-slash-programmer/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/"&gt;Automate the Boring Stuff With Python&lt;/a&gt;
is a great resource for boosting your productivity also.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not easy to decide whether or not school is for you. I'm still unsure after a year and a half of programming on the side. No matter what, continue to learn multiple languages and strive for a better grasp of the ones you know. Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My decision: continue self-study and learning online for free.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 8 months after writing this post, I have concluded that learning for free online was the right
choice for me. I've achieved many of my programming goals in the last three years,
thanks to materials available from &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python"&gt;Codeacademy&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python"&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3d-n41Tobw"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1720421/how-to-concatenate-two-lists-in-python?rq=1"&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/"&gt;countless helpful resources,&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pymotw.com/3/glob/index.html"&gt;interesting blogs&lt;/a&gt;,
and &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;. I've talked with others who need
the in-person assistance that a bootcamp offers to learn. Do what works for you. Good luck with your decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years later after writing this post, I was lucky enough to land a job where
I used Python and Excel for a living! I studied for free online intermittently about 4 years to achieve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I began my coding endeavors in the fall of 2015. After 6 months of

steady &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/03/11/random-findings/"&gt;coding practice and studying&lt;/a&gt;, I
went from no knowledge to a basic hobbyist programmer capable of
creating a website with the help of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/03/03/starting-to-almost-kinda-think-about-creating-a-web-app/"&gt;a framework&lt;/a&gt;.
I published a few of my own primitive apps. Then I relapsed. Coding and
my full-time job wore me out. I stayed away from coding for about 6
months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ultimate goal to learn to code was to be able to build my own
websites and apps. I've done that now. I've found ways to do it more
efficiently, which I will share in future posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of my recent moonshot projects were Social Queues, a social playlist
builder for Spotify and Dropcycle, a bicycle on demand pick-up service.
Neither went anywhere, or really were that good of ideas, but I was able
to get to bare minimum viable product status, with little to no code.
Sites like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://carrd.co"&gt;carrd.co&lt;/a&gt; work well to build a quick
landing page as proof of concept or landing page test. My favorite
project might be my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tameimpala.pythonanywhere.com/tameimpala"&gt;Tame Impala website&lt;/a&gt;,
which I used &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://lofipython.com/getting-started-with-web2py/"&gt;web2py&lt;/a&gt;
to build the site and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pythonanywhere.com"&gt;pythonanywhere&lt;/a&gt; to host for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My aspirations have shifted. Instead of just building apps, I want to
build apps that are useful to others and help me achieve financial
freedom and the ability to own my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe in cycles of learning. Similar to being in school: semester of
study, then time off to rest, then semester of study, more rest, etc.
The time away is as important as the time of study. Earlier this year, I
returned to programming and web development. After a long time of not
writing on this blog, I'm back at it. New cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

Once you've gotten a basic grip on Python, you might be ready to learn about web frameworks.
A web framework consists of software designed to aid in web development. They make it easier
to create a website or web app, if you know how to use them. Unfortunately, there is a
learning curve to using the frameworks but thankfully there is plenty o' documentation to
go around to help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the two &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.airpair.com/python/posts/django-flask-pyramid"&gt;Python Frameworks&lt;/a&gt; I've chosen to investigate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Django: widely used, great community support, comes with just about everything built in. Can be used for smaller apps or multi-page/app websites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flask: a &amp;quot;microframework&amp;quot; used for smaller apps. Possibly more manageable for someone beginning a smaller project, like me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as a beginner-level coder, I've chosen to start with Flask. I also found
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://opentechschool.github.io/python-flask/"&gt;this sweet guide&lt;/a&gt; that I think will help.
Maybe someday I will graduate to Django, it sounds like a great framework. I've also decided that
first I need to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design"&gt;brush up on my HTML&lt;/a&gt;.
According to a lot of what I've read it doesn't hurt to know CSS/Javascript. So this whole
&amp;quot;build a web app&amp;quot; idea will continue, albeit with some hurdles to clear first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: I ended up choosing web2py, which I hadn't even considered when I wrote this originally!
Here's a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://lofipython.com/choosing-a-web-development-path/"&gt;post about why I chose it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
