&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage One - Beginner's Thrill:&lt;/strong&gt; A rapid growth and learning pace
at the beginning, because I'm conquering a lot of small goals, diving
into something new and there are rapid gains which feels great.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage One - Beginner's Thrill:&lt;/strong&gt; A rapid growth and learning pace
at the beginning, because I'm conquering a lot of small goals, diving
into something new and there are rapid gains which feels great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Two - Amateur's Reality:&lt;/strong&gt;The pace of learning and
accomplishment levels off. I'm still learning, but the leaps forward
start following a plateau trajectory. This stage is not as rewarding
as the first. The key is to push through and jump to the next plateau
and keep improving.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Three - Mastery:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the goal with most things I want
to learn, and if I gain enough experience and skill, I'll have the
ability to apply the new things I've learned to accomplish my goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my own way of paraphrasing what I've read a million times on the
internet - put in the hours, stay focused and don't stop trying. Right
now I'm somewhere around stage one/two with Python. Gotta keep pushing
forward. (This blog is also serving as a pep talk to myself.)&lt;/p&gt;
