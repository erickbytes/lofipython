Carve out those little moments where you can automate tedious tasks or study up on that &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm"&gt;hot new Python library&lt;/a&gt; that takes your quality to another level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take time to reorganize and refactor in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://atom.io/"&gt;your favorite text editor&lt;/a&gt;. Break your script, then break it again. Break it until it works. Absorb your new abilities as a machine literate human and build skills on top of skills. Make a breakthrough. The code is great. It makes sense. Another tweak here, another tweak there. Run &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psf/black"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; on it and then have a go at &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/"&gt;PEP-8&lt;/a&gt; to brush up on your style. More tweaks, and need to add some &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/"&gt;docstrings&lt;/a&gt; for more clarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another one bites the dust. Who knows where your skills could grow. Following the code is a delightful road. Some days it's hard. Some days it's easy. But it's fulfilling if you treat it like a locksmith does keys. Knowledge is flowing. The craft is built in each moment. Challenges overcome. Battles won. New innovations to munge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code is the medium to communicate with machines and leverage their efficiency for convenient means. Tighter the web we weave with transistors and screens, the more we'll need dignified intermediaries of man and machine. Here's to the good code and the bad code we all will write. May we never let something stop our logical flights to code a better dream.&lt;/p&gt;
