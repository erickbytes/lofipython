My average CPM or cost per thousand impressions was $0.14. My blog averages about 1,600 views a month at the moment, mostly fueled by various search engines. Here's an example of one ad that ran:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-image-6185 figure"&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example Ad Run on This Site Shown Above&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my WordPress account, I upgraded to the business plan. This gave me access to WordPress plug-ins. I enabled the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/"&gt;Yoast SEO plug-in&lt;/a&gt; and activated its site optimization. I also enabled the maximum ads possible in my settings. In spite of these efforts, the results were sparse. Maybe there's more that I could have done. But this blog is passive and more like a hobby at the moment. I'm ok with a blog that makes $0.86 per month. Maybe someday it will be worth more. But I enjoy writing so it's all good. My skills grow and maybe I share something with someone across the world. That's what keeps me coming back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I concluded I will not be running ads anytime soon. I wanted to get a baseline of what I was leaving on the table by not running ads. Now I can project when I might tap into the blog's potential traffic revenue, if ever. It seems I would need much higher views per month before ads makes sense with my level of traffic, 65 blog followers and minor social media clout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There's also the added benefit of not serving up people's data to ad companies. Ads seem to be a generally accepted way to earn from your internet labors. But right now, they're not for this blog. Good luck monetizing your blog. Or just writing for the hell of it!&lt;/p&gt;
