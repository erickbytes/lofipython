Once you've gotten a basic grip on Python, you might be ready to learn about web frameworks. A web framework consists of software designed to aid in web development. They make it easier to create a website or web app - if you know how to use them. Unfortunately, there is a learning curve to using the frameworks but thankfully there is plenty o' documentation to go around to help you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the two &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.airpair.com/python/posts/django-flask-pyramid"&gt;Python Frameworks&lt;/a&gt; I've chosen to investigate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Django - widely used, great community support, comes with just about everything built in. Can be used for smaller apps or multi-page/app websites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flask - a &amp;quot;microframework&amp;quot; used for smaller apps. Possibly more manageable for someone beginning a smaller project (me!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as a beginnerish-level coder, I've chosen to start with Flask; I also found &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://opentechschool.github.io/python-flask/"&gt;this sweet guide&lt;/a&gt; that I think will help. Maybe someday I will graduate to Django, it sounds like a great framework. I've also decided that first I need to &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design"&gt;brush up on my HTML&lt;/a&gt; - And according to a lot of what I've read it doesn't hurt to know CSS/Javascript. So this whole &amp;quot;build a web app&amp;quot; idea will continue, albeit with some hurdles to clear first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edit: I ended up choosing web2py, which I hadn't even considered when I wrote this originally! Here's a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://lofipython.com/choosing-a-web-development-path/"&gt;post about why I chose it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
