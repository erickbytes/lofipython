but I have 4 years of high school classes and ~2 more years of real world experience. Spanish is not spoke in a bubble.
It needs to be practiced to be learned. I put much effort into listening. There is much more I have to learn. Typically,
I try to compensate for some lack of skills with intense focus. Sometimes I know what is said and more often
I am closer to guessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this walk down the street, I attempted to listen to my friends speak. In the back of my mind, I was frustrated
because the noise of the cars going past us and a city in motion made it near impossible to hear the words. Similarly, attempting
to listen in a bar, party or anywhere playing music is very tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to think, &amp;quot;if only it was more quiet!&amp;quot; while walking and straining to hear what my friends said over the noise.
Today I had an epiphany: there's always background noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A difference between textbooks and real life: there's usually noise in the background.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should embrace practicing and growing our skills because there will always be &amp;quot;noise&amp;quot;.
This is a tidy metaphor for distraction and our focus bandwidth. In the lens of coding, the &amp;quot;noise&amp;quot; might be
skill deficiencies and lack of understanding, other co-workers, unimportant projects, meetings, social media, games
and anything that misdirects us away from our primary goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's easy to get annoyed when there is excessive noise. It makes it way harder to hear what is being said.
Nonetheless, I don't have to let the noise distract my effort and intention to learn. So it is with programming and all skills.
There will always be &amp;quot;noise&amp;quot;. Embrace the noise and lean heavily on your intention to practice.&lt;/p&gt;
