&lt;p&gt;I began my coding endeavors in the fall of 2015. After 6 months of steady &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/03/11/random-findings/"&gt;coding practice and studying&lt;/a&gt;, I went from no knowledge to a basic hobbyist programmer capable of creating a website with the help â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We move in cycles.

&lt;p&gt;I began my coding endeavors in the fall of 2015. After 6 months of steady &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/03/11/random-findings/"&gt;coding practice and studying&lt;/a&gt;, I went from no knowledge to a basic hobbyist programmer capable of creating a website with the help of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/03/03/starting-to-almost-kinda-think-about-creating-a-web-app/"&gt;a framework&lt;/a&gt;. I published a few of my own primitive apps. Then I relapsed. Coding and my full-time job wore me out. I stayed away from coding for about 6 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ultimate goal to learn to code was to be able to build my own websites and apps. I've done that now. I've found ways to do it more efficiently, which I will share in future posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of my recent moonshot projects were&amp;nbsp;Social Queues, a social playlist builder for Spotify and Dropcycle, a bicycle on demand pick-up service. Neither went anywhere, or really were that good of ideas, but I was able to get to bare minimum viable product status, with little to no code. Sites like &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://carrd.co"&gt;carrd.co&lt;/a&gt; work well to build a quick landing page as proof of concept or landing page test. My favorite project might be my &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://tameimpala.pythonanywhere.com"&gt;Tame Impala website&lt;/a&gt;, which I used &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/03/29/getting-started-with-web2py/"&gt;web2py&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to build the site and &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pythonanywhere,com"&gt;pythonanywhere&lt;/a&gt; to host for free :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My aspirations have shifted. Instead of just building apps, I want to build apps that are useful to others and help me achieve financial freedom and the ability to own my time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe in cycles of learning. Similar to being in school: semester of study, then time off to rest, then semester of study, more rest, etc. The time away is as important as the time of study. Earlier this year, I returned to programming and web development. After a long time of not writing on this blog, I'm back at it. New cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
