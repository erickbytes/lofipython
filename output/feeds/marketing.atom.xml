at the University of Illinois and 4 years of professional experience in
Marketing. So here they are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;It's easier to sell one thing than several different products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distribution = Very Important (Duh!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing depends a lot â€¦&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Tonight, I made a list of 15 things I've observed after 4 years of study
at the University of Illinois and 4 years of professional experience in
Marketing. So here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's easier to sell one thing than several different products.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distribution = Very Important (Duh!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marketing depends a lot on product quality - what can you do for the
user/customer? What problems can you solve?
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2016/02/fit-and-finish.html"&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt; talks about this quite often.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design matters - in product, communications, and everything else in
this world.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sell benefits, not features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People are emotional buyers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more you know about your customer, the better.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Budget and resources matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There can be an extremely wide variance from industry to industry -
the key is to look for parallels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Humanize your company as much as possible - &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://members.cdbaby.com/shipping-confirmation.aspx"&gt;This is a great example&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You're more likely to find success with talented people around you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be aware of the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle"&gt;Pareto Principle&lt;/a&gt; (The 80/20 Rule)
- 80% of results often come from 20% of customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ads that annoy / shout about your product don't work; Ads that tell
customers useful information or help them in some way do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is such a thing as too many choices for the customer - it
overwhelms them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice brevity. Whatever you've got to say, do it in fewer words.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
