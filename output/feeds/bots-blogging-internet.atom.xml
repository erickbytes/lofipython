&lt;p&gt;Bots are crawling the internet. They make up a large chunk of all web traffic.
On my blogs, I've always used the robots.txt to say to bots, &amp;quot;scrape away!&amp;quot; like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
User-agent: *
Disallow:
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some websites use a robots.txt to say, &amp;quot;don't scrape our content â€¦&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bots and robots.txt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We can ask crawlers to restrict from crawling, but this is more or less an honor system.
For this blog, I always welcomed all real traffic but activated Cloudflare's &amp;quot;Bot Fight Mode&amp;quot; to
to protect against some of the bots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloudflare Rolls Out New AI Blocker Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed in my Cloudflare Pages dashboard that a new setting has become available to me on the free plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="toggle cloudflare AI bot blocker" src="https://lofipython.com/images/cloudflare-LLM-blocker.png" /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Block AI Bots Configuration on Cloudflare Pages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;I now have another level of security available if I want to use it. For now, I'm choosing to keep
my blogs open to all traffic, including AIs while excluding some bots. Anyone who publishes
to the open internet will have to assess their willingness to open up their site and trust that it will come back to them
in some way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can block artificial intelligence (AI) bots, crawlers, and scrapers from scraping
your website content and training large language models (LLM) to recreate it without
your permission. When you enable this feature via a pre-configured managed rule,
Cloudflare can detect and block AI bots from your website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot/#ai-bots"&gt;AI Bots&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If an LLM is just a remix of all the data it consumes, how do we trace the origin of its results?
And how does that get attributed back? It seemed easier to tell with Google's link based search results.
But even then, there was a lack of transparency. It's still that way today. I appreciate that Cloudflare is putting
this choice to block or not block AIs in the hands of website makers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crawler Traffic on lofipython.com, Aug. - Sept. 2024&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point of this post was not to answer the question, but instead reflect on the nuances of web creators
and their relationship with big tech. Everyone will have to decide for themselves if they think it's worth it.
In this case, we're likely &amp;quot;paid in exposure&amp;quot;. Big tech will distill the value of what we write to inquiring
humans and reference back with links. Will website creators lose out on this exchange? Are we cutting off a
channel of distribution if we push back against LLMs scooping up our data? Right now there seems to be
more questions than answers. We'll see.&lt;/p&gt;
