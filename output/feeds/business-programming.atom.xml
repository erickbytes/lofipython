I would like to begin sharing my journey through the coding world. I have chosen Python
as my language to explore, to start. I began last fall by completing three &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python"&gt;free online courses on Coursera&lt;/a&gt;.
It's taught by an amazing professor, Dr. Charles Severance from the University of Michigan.
Check these courses out if you want an epic introduction to Python and coding in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I previously had a little bit of HTML experience, nothing else. I am very new to coding
and enjoying learning a little more every day. I'm going to post my trials, problems,
and things I figure out along the way and anything else I find interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why do I want to learn to program?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rapidly growing segments of our lives rely on computers and similar technologies. It seems unwise to remain ignorant of their internal processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web apps are cool, useful and make our lives better. I'd like to build them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To strengthen myself professionally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To CREATE - coding is actually a very great creative outlet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Python?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a language that emphasizes readability, is very versatile and has a great community
of users to help you solve problems. It can be used for everything from the front end
functionality, user interface, etc. to the back end - data storage, server use, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My goal is to get better every day, and eventually build some cool shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading,
Erick&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*At the time I wrote this, I worked in a non-technical marketing role. After beginning my Python studies,
I later found a role where I essentially got paid to write code that automated processes for a business.
If you're wondering how, I used &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://lofipython.com/pandas-pythons-excel-powerhouse/"&gt;Pandas&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api"&gt;Requests&lt;/a&gt; and Excel a lot at most recent gig.&lt;/p&gt;
