                <p>Python comes with a bunch of <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html">standard modules</a>. My favorites are shutil, glob, datetime, time, os (operating system), re (regular expressions) and webbrowser. The standard library is loaded.</p>
<p>Inevitably, you'll want to install new libraries from Python's rich ecosystem of external modules. Enter pip, Python's handy package manager and people's champion.</p>
<p>This post will teach you some Python history, show how to install pandas, and help you troubleshoot problems if it's not working. You'll find Windows and Linux commands for venv setup (recommended). With pip, you'll feel like Neo when installing new modules. Any skill is at your fingertips. It's like learning kung fu. There's probably a library for that!</p>

<p>First, Some Python Version Caveats + History**
**
------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Python 2 reached end of life on January 1st, 2020</strong>. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/">Python 2 has officially been sunset</a>.</p>
<p>Python comes with pip now, no setup is required. But certain versions such as Python 3.2 or the Python 2.7 that came stock on my improbably still functioning 2008 black Macbook, for example, may not have it installed.</p>
<p><strong>In December 2021, Python 3.6 reached</strong><a class="reference external" href="https://devguide.python.org/devcycle/#end-of-life-branches">&quot;end of life phase&quot;</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Python 3.6 is &quot;now effectively frozen&quot;. Read more in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0494/">PEP 494</a>. (Released Oct. 2022)</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> use Python 3.7 to 3.11. This blog endorses using the lightning fast Python version <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/">3.11.</a></p>
<div class="section" id="enter-this-in-your-terminal">
<h2>Enter This in Your Terminal</h2>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">python <span class="pre">-m</span> pip install pandas</tt></p>
<p>Pandas is a super useful library for wrangling spreadsheet data, AKA &quot;tabular&quot; data. If successful, you should see activity that looks similar to the below screenshot, where I am installing <a class="reference external" href="https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">openpyxl</a>, an additional Python Excel library you'll likely want. You are good to go! This is the part where you get to feel like Neo! See <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html">Installing Python Modules</a> in the Python Documentation for more detailed instructions.</p>

<p><strong>You should follow best practice and</strong> <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">create a virtual environment</a> <strong>before installing libraries.</strong><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html">venv</a><strong>or</strong><a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/04/10/creating-isolated-python-environments-with-virtualenv/">virtualenv</a><strong>will help you out. To create with venv:</strong></p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">python3 <span class="pre">-m</span> venv add_env_name_here</tt></p>
<p>After your environment is created, activate it with the first command below, then install a library on Ubuntu Linux:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">cd add_env_path_here/bin &amp; source activate</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">python <span class="pre">-m</span> pip install pandas</tt></li>
</ol>
<p>Alternatively, on Windows computers:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">cd add_env_path_here\scripts &amp; activate</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">python <span class="pre">-m</span> pip install pandas</tt></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Know your OS.</strong></p>
<p>If you're interested in installing pip on Linux, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tecmint.com/install-pip-in-linux/">try here</a>. For Mac, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.shellhacks.com/python-install-pip-mac-ubuntu-centos/">try here</a>. Windows, Mac and Linux sometimes use different prefixes (e.g. python, py, python3) to run a python script. Which leads me to my next point...</p>
<p><strong>Getting the prefix right can be tricky.</strong></p>
<p>Since this was written, I moved to Python 3.8. When I first moved from Python 2 to 3 on Windows, I somehow accidentally configured the following behavior: entering <strong>python some_program.py</strong>&nbsp;ran a .py file with Python 2. Whereas, entering <strong>py some_program.py</strong>ran a .py file with Python 3.</p>
<p>In the install command, the prefix is a reference to your Python executable. You may just need to alter your prefix to call it correctly. Here are some to try in place of &quot;python&quot;. Observe what happens when you run these command variations.Good luck!</p>

<p>Go to the link, right click the page and &quot;Save As&quot; a .py file to download. Then place the file where you want to access it. I placed mine in&nbsp;C:Python27Libsite-packages</p>
<p>You could also download the file with <a class="reference external" href="https://curl.haxx.se/">curl</a>:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">curl <span class="pre">https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py</span> <span class="pre">-o</span> <span class="pre">get-pip.pyt-pip.py</span></tt></p>

<p><strong>Run the get-pip.py file.</strong></p>
<p>Using command prompt's cd command with a Windows &quot;&amp;&quot; operator to run the Python file in a Windows command prompt:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">cd <span class="pre">c:\Python27\Lib\site-packages</span> &amp; python <span class="pre">get-pip.py</span></tt></p>
<p>Or Linux terminal:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">cd <span class="pre">/Python27/Lib/site-packages</span> &amp;&amp; python <span class="pre">get-pip.py</span></tt></p>
<p>You should see some activity in command prompt that shows installation/updating of &quot;setup&quot; and &quot;wheel&quot;. When it finishes, you have installed pip.</p>
<p><strong>Type into command prompt at the same location:</strong></p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">python <span class="pre">-m</span> pip install requests</tt></p>
<p>This should install the Requests module into your Python libraries. Requests is an http module which is highly regarded almost universally by the Python community.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>The basis of many great programs revolve around a simple set of operations:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Open a file.</li>
<li>Do something with the file contents.</li>
<li>Save the new file for the user.</li>
</ol>
<p>Python is nice and simple for this.&nbsp;Paste the below lines into a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=text+editor&amp;oq=text+edit&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.2054j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">text editor</a> and save as a .py file. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki/Python-&amp;-pip-Windows-installation">You need to have Python 3 installed</a>. In the same folder as your .py file, save a .txt file with some words in it. Alright, let's write some code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span>
<span class="normal">2</span>
<span class="normal">3</span>
<span class="normal">4</span>
<span class="normal">5</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><span class="n">file_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Enter your file name. e.g. words.txt&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">file_handle</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">file_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;r&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">lines</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">file_handle</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">readlines</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="nb">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lines</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">file_handle</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">close</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div></td></tr></table></div>
<p>In line 1, we ask the user to enter their file name with Python's raw_input function. When the program runs, the user enters their text file name with extension. This line stores the name in a variable called file_name.</p>
<p><strong>In line 2,</strong> we open your text file and store it in a variable I have named file_handle. Think of the file handle as a bridge between your code and the text file. Quick point about the 'r' above: that tells the program to open the file in &quot;Read&quot; mode. There are several different file modes in programming. Some modes are just for reading an existing file, some are just for writing a new file, and some are capable of both. <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16208206/confused-by-python-file-mode-w/16208298">This Stack Overflow post</a> is well written and details the differences between file modes. Once established, the file handle allows you to read the file's contents or write new contents to the file.</p>
<p><strong>In line 3,</strong>&nbsp;we are calling the .readlines() method on our file handle. This method takes the file contents and stores them, line by line, into a list named &quot;lines&quot;. An alternative method is .read(), which opens the file and stores its contents as one string. Try switching this out in place of&nbsp; .readlines() to check out the difference.</p>
<p><strong>In line 4,</strong> we are printing the stored lines to show them to the user. We now have the file contents, ready to be used however we please.</p>
<p><strong>In line 5</strong>, we are closing the file.</p>
<p>Below, we are going to write a new file. Let's pretend we've done something worth saving with our lines and now want to save them to a new file. We will represent this as the variable &quot;output&quot; in the first line below.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
file_name = input(&quot;Enter any file name.&quot;)
save_file = open(file_name, &quot;w&quot;)
save_file.write(&quot;Here is some text to save in a file.&quot;)
save_file.close()
</pre>
<p>In line 1, we are using Python's input function to ask the user what to name the file and storing it in a variable named file_name.</p>
<p>In line 2,&nbsp; we are calling the open function again that we used in the first example, but this time, notice the &quot;w&quot;. This indicates that we are opening the file in &quot;write&quot; mode.</p>
<p>In line 3, we are calling the .write() method on our file handle, named save_file, and passing it our text to be saved in our new file.</p>
<p><strong>In line 4</strong>, we are closing the file, completing the creation of our new file in the same folder as our .py program file.</p>
<p>Your program is now ready to be run. Double-click your .py file to execute it.</p>
<p>Before learning Python, file operations were a mystery to me. It took me a while to understand this clearly, and I wanted to share. Once you master these basic file operations, programming gets to be a lot more fun. Do try it out for yourself :D</p>

                <p>Here is what I have deduced is the fastest way to get an app up and running with Node.js. This requires some familiarity with using the command line.&nbsp;I completed the Codeacademy course &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line">Learn The Command Line</a>&quot; before beginning with Node.js. I think it helped me better understand what the commands are and what they do.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Download and install&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.JS</a></li>
<li>Open the node command prompt. (This was on a windows machine.)</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">mkdir node_apps</tt><ul>
<li>creates a folder for your app(s)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">cd \app_name</tt><ul>
<li>changes command prompt directory to your app's folder</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">npm &nbsp;init</tt><ul>
<li>Creates json file for your app</li>
<li>fill out applicable info or just hit enter until the file is created</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">npm install express</tt><ul>
<li>installs express.js module in node.js</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">npm install <span class="pre">express-generator</span> <span class="pre">-g</span></tt><ul>
<li>installs express-generator module in node.js</li>
<li>this module creates the web app's structure once the command in the next step is entered</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">express app_name</tt><ul>
<li>creates the structure for your app and all necessary folders. (views, css, Javascript, routing, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">npm install</tt><ul>
<li>ensures all app module dependencies are installed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">npm start</tt><ul>
<li>starts your server and web app</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go to <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> in a browser. Port 3000 is the default port of Express.<ul>
<li>Your app is live.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I learned most of this from <a class="reference external" href="https://codeforgeek.com/2014/10/express-complete-tutorial-part-1/">this great blog post</a>.</li>
<li>The above does not include a database integration. I integrated with a MongoDB database by <a class="reference external" href="https://closebrace.com/tutorials/2017-03-02/the-dead-simple-step-by-step-guide-for-front-end-developers-to-getting-up-and-running-with-nodejs-express-and-mongodb">following the instructions in this post</a>.</li>
<li>This <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uFY60CESlM">YouTube video</a> was also very helpful to me for figuring out MongoDB and Node.js integration.</li>
<li>An HTML shorthand language called jade (aka pug) comes stock within Express.js.&nbsp; <a class="reference external" href="https://webapplog.com/jade/">Here's further reading</a> on the pros and cons.</li>
<li>All of the above has been from my own studies. I do not claim anything listed as the most efficient or best way to use Node.js. This is what has worked for me over the past two days.</li>
<li>It feels good to whip up a nimble app environment that is capable of producing and supporting world changing software; Node.js is used by Netflix, PayPal, Microsoft and Uber.</li>

                <p>I'm finally coming around in my understanding of Javascript. Here are a few quick explanations to help you if you are new to it.</p>
<p><strong>Javascript</strong> = The language of the web. Most commonly used as a complement to HTML and CSS to create an interactive website.</p>
<p><strong>JQuery</strong> = A popular Javascript library with many powerful commands that are quick and easy to call.</p>
<p><strong>Node.JS</strong> = Software that allows you to run Javascript from the command line without being connected to the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Express.JS</strong> = A popular Node.JS framework.</p>
<p><strong>Angular</strong> = A popular front-end Javascript web framework. There are many out there but this seems to be the one I've heard of the most.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>I've begun to see a pattern with programming languages:</strong></div>
<div class="line">1) Learn to execute the core building blocks. (using variables, loops, functions, etc.)</div>
<div class="line">2) Learn more advanced libraries, documentation and uses.</div>
<div class="line">3) Consider using and learning web frameworks depending on what you're trying to do with the language.</div>
<div class="line">4) Practice to hone your knowledge. Build things you like.</div>
</div>
<p>I've also noticed that Javascript has been easier to learn than Python was for me, because it's not my first programming language. The concepts are the same. The syntax can trip me up at times, but I'm currently flying through <a class="reference external" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript">Codeacademy's Javascript courses</a>. Sometimes it even seems fun!</p>

<li>Use combinatory play. Take ideas from different disciplines and combine them to bring about new ideas. //&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/08/14/how-einstein-thought-combinatorial-creativity/">Brain Pickings</a></li>
<li>Invest in improving your product versus marketing. A great product is obvious to a potential customer.&nbsp;//&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">Seth Godin</a></li>
<li>People remember how you or your product made them feel versus cost, etc.</li>
<li>An idea doesn't have to be revolutionary. Many new businesses or products take an existing product and make a slight modification or add a new twist.</li>
<li>Many of the successful people during the gold rush sold pick-axes to the miners.</li>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer. Below are some thoughts that may help you decide.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>What are your programming goals? Get a coding job? Create an app or website? Become more productive at your current job?</li>
<li>What is your current experience level? Are you starting fresh or do you already know a language or two?</li>
<li>Do you have money saved up? Otherwise, you might need to take out a loan.</li>
</ol>
<p>A computer science degree is typically most expensive. Coding bootcamps are a lower cost option that pack a wide curriculum into a few weeks or months, but they can still be pricey. The cheapest option is to take a piecemeal approach through various online courses.</p>
<p><strong>School Advantages</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Wholistic approach. You get the ins and outs of programming from a proven curriculum.</li>
<li>Community. You learn with other students and from experienced teachers.</li>
<li>Job placement. Often various schools and bootcamps will connect you to a company.</li>
<li>Credentials. You gain confidence and the backing of your skills by an established institution.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Downsides</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Tuition Money. A lot of&nbsp;what you need to know is available for free or cheap on the web.</li>
<li>Skill level match. Some bootcamps are oriented for beginners, others are more advanced. If you do a bootcamp, make sure it fits your skill level.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you want a coding job</strong>, school makes sense. The bootcamps look to be effective if you can handle the up-front investment. It's possible to land a job without schooling but much tougher. I am currently considering <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com/">Full Stack Academy</a>. and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.codingdojo.com/">Coding Dojo</a>. There are many out there. CodeAcademy is a popular route as well.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to make an app or website</strong>, the school or the non-school route may both work. For the non-school route, the following languages are good places to start: <em>(note - not a comprehensive list, these are my picks.)</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Web App or Website: HTML, CSS,&nbsp;Python, Javascript</li>
<li>Web App or Website Framework:&nbsp; Flask, Django, py4web, Ruby on Rails, React</li>
<li>iOS app: Swift plus Apple's Xcode environment, Beeware (python library)</li>
<li>Android App: Java or Kotlin, Beeware</li>
<li>General Coding: Python or Ruby</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you want to be more productive at work</strong>, I recommend learning Python. More on Python and where to start <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/02/22/marketer-slash-programmer/">here</a>.&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate the Boring Stuff With Python</a> is a great resource for boosting your productivity also.</p>
<p>It's not easy to decide whether or not school is for you. I'm still unsure after a year and a half of programming on the side. No matter what, continue to learn multiple languages and strive for a better grasp of the ones you know. Good luck!</p>
<p><strong>My decision: continue self-study and learning online for free.</strong></p>
<p>As of 8 months after writing this post, I have concluded that learning for free online was the right choice for me. I've achieved many of my programming goals in the last three years, thanks to materials available from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python">Codeacademy</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python">Coursera</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3d-n41Tobw">YouTube</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1720421/how-to-concatenate-two-lists-in-python?rq=1">Stack Overflow</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">countless helpful resources,</a><a class="reference external" href="https://pymotw.com/3/glob/index.html">interesting blogs</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html">documentation</a>. I've talked with others who need the in-person assistance that a bootcamp offers to learn. Do what works for you. Good luck with your decision.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Several years later, I also get paid to use Python and Excel for a living! I studied for free online intermittently over 2 years to achieve it.</p>

                <p>We move in cycles. Work, rest, re-energize, play, repeat. The rhythm of life.</p>
<p>I began my coding endeavors in the fall of 2015. After 6 months of steady <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/03/11/random-findings/">coding practice and studying</a>, I went from no knowledge to a basic hobbyist programmer capable of creating a website with the help of <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/03/03/starting-to-almost-kinda-think-about-creating-a-web-app/">a framework</a>. I published a few of my own primitive apps. Then I relapsed. Coding and my full-time job wore me out. I stayed away from coding for about 6 months.</p>
<p>My ultimate goal to learn to code was to be able to build my own websites and apps. I've done that now. I've found ways to do it more efficiently, which I will share in future posts.</p>
<p>Two of my recent moonshot projects were&nbsp;Social Queues, a social playlist builder for Spotify and Dropcycle, a bicycle on demand pick-up service. Neither went anywhere, or really were that good of ideas, but I was able to get to bare minimum viable product status, with little to no code. Sites like <a class="reference external" href="http://carrd.co">carrd.co</a> work well to build a quick landing page as proof of concept or landing page test. My favorite project might be my <a class="reference external" href="http://tameimpala.pythonanywhere.com">Tame Impala website</a>, which I used <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/03/29/getting-started-with-web2py/">web2py</a>&nbsp;to build the site and <a class="reference external" href="http://pythonanywhere,com">pythonanywhere</a> to host for free :)</p>
<p>My aspirations have shifted. Instead of just building apps, I want to build apps that are useful to others and help me achieve financial freedom and the ability to own my time.</p>
<p>I believe in cycles of learning. Similar to being in school: semester of study, then time off to rest, then semester of study, more rest, etc. The time away is as important as the time of study. Earlier this year, I returned to programming and web development. After a long time of not writing on this blog, I'm back at it. New cycle.</p>

                <p>Most&nbsp;new skills&nbsp;I've tried to learn seem to follow a similar trajectory:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Stage One - Beginner's Thrill:</strong> A rapid growth and learning pace at the beginning, because I'm&nbsp;conquering a lot of small goals, diving into something new and there are rapid gains which feels great.</li>
<li><strong>Stage Two - Amateur's Reality:</strong>&nbsp;The pace of learning and accomplishment levels off.&nbsp;I'm still&nbsp;learning, but&nbsp;the&nbsp;leaps forward start following a plateau trajectory. This stage is not as rewarding as the first. The key is to push through and jump to the next plateau and keep improving.</li>
<li><strong>Stage Three - Mastery:</strong> This is the goal with most things I&nbsp;want to learn, and if I&nbsp;gain enough experience and skill, I'll have the ability to apply the&nbsp;new things I've learned to accomplish my&nbsp;goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is my own&nbsp;way of paraphrasing what I've read a million times on the internet - put in the hours, stay focused and don't stop trying. Right now I'm somewhere around&nbsp;stage one/two with Python. Gotta&nbsp;keep pushing forward. (This blog is also serving as a pep talk to myself.)</p>

                <p>Feeling really good about my progress with web2py. The tutorial videos are comprehensive, yet easy to understand. For a beginner, the &quot;batteries included&quot; philosophy that web2py has embraced is a godsend. This means&nbsp;everything you need to get creating comes stock. I <a class="reference external" href="http://www.web2py.com/init/default/download">downloaded the web2py program</a>, ran it, entered a password, and was immediately using&nbsp;a functional development interface.</p>
<p>web2py follows the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model - View - Controller software architecture</a>&nbsp;- which means it separates out the activities of programs into a few different layers (please forgive my oversimplified explanations):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Model - Stores data / used&nbsp;in tutorial for database table creation (Written in Python)</li>
<li>Controller - Used to define page functions (Python)</li>
<li>Views - What the user sees (HTML/CSS/Javascript)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>(Image&nbsp;from web2py Documentation)</em></p>
<p><strong>If you're thinking about trying web2py&nbsp;here's a few things that I've really liked so far:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I have minimal knowledge outside of&nbsp;a few basic concepts of server operations. web2py provides a few simple lines of code that allows quick creation of a table (done in model) and corresponding form (done in controller/view) to add entries to the table and display form submissions elsewhere on your site.</li>
<li>Right now, I'm enjoying learning&nbsp;about the <a class="reference external" href="https://py4web.com/_documentation/static/en/chapter-05.html">Database Abstraction Layer (DAL),</a> which is pretty cool because you can rapidly run and test complex server queries within it.</li>
<li>It's set up for multiple applications, so I can create and play with&nbsp;several projects at once, whether simple applications or more complex websites.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 30 videos total on the web2py documentation page, and I've only watched 11 of them but have already learned a ton. The style of the Massimo Di Pierro is great because you often pick up on some golden nuggets of coding wisdom and programming&nbsp;tips while he walks you through the topic.</p>
<p>It's pretty sweet&nbsp;to be able to create and manipulate a website so quickly; still need to learn more, such as pick up CSS to really make it my own. But for now I'm happy for the many small accomplishments&nbsp;that have been easier to reach thanks to web2py.</p>
