                <p>A static site generator creates static HTML and markdown files to serve as a website. They're commonly used to host blogs but not exclusively. I recently researched my options to roll a static site in Python. I'm assessing a few of them as a potential future self-hosted blogging solution for this Wordpress blog. Or maybe I'll spin up a new one!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why Statics?</strong></p>
<p>Most &quot;modern&quot; websites are <em>dynamic</em> in the sense that the contents of the site live in a database, and are converted into presentation-ready HTML only when a user wants to see the page. That's great. However, it presents some minor issues that static site generators try to solve.</p>
<p>In a static site, the whole site, every page, <em>everything</em>, is created before the first user even sees it and uploaded to the server as a simple folder full of HTML files (and images, CSS, etc).</p>

                <p>You read the whole thing front to back? Every word? Stop and think about it. What is the computer trying to tell you?</p>
<p>Sometimes something is obvious but needs to be reminded. I found myself thinking this yet again today. Often there are times where I would have saved some time and grief by carefully reading the error.</p>
<p>Carefully read the error when you see a traceback. Then once you've taken it all in, consider what to do next. If you're stumped, googling it might yield a solution. But make sure you actually read the error first.</p>

                <p>After 12 years with Gmail as my primary email inbox, I wanted to clear out old &quot;Promotions&quot; emails. This can be done with some clever use of Gmail's search syntax shown below.</p>
<p>I wanted to preserve my &quot;Starred&quot; emails, but delete old emails to free up space. I was able to delete 58,000 &quot;Promotions&quot; emails! I wrote this post because I feel it might save you a little time figuring it out yourself. I also included brief details on possible Python tools for Gmail and IMAP below if you are considering scripting your contact management.</p>
<p>I didn't need Python in the end after reading some <a class="reference external" href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190?hl=en">Gmail search operator examples</a>. For example, adding a hypen before a search in Gmail acts similar to a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#NOT">&quot;bitwise&quot; or unary operator (~)</a> in Python. It excludes or inverses the criteria in a search rather than including it. I was able to use this to exclude my starred emails. You can also add a filter for &quot;has attachment&quot;. I used that to star any emails with attachments, then delete the rest and excluded &quot;starred&quot; emails.</p>
<p><strong>Gmail search syntax to get &quot;Promotions&quot; minus &quot;Starred&quot; emails and filter on a date range</strong>:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">category:promotions <span class="pre">-is:starred</span> after:2019/12/31 before:2021/1/1</tt></p>
<p><strong>Selecting &quot;all&quot; emails in your search</strong></p>

<p><strong>Once, you've selected &quot;All&quot; from the checkbox dropdown, click &quot;Select all conversations that match this search&quot;.</strong> Now you can apply actions such as &quot;add a star&quot; or &quot;delete&quot; them by clicking the (⋮) vertical ellipses menu:</p>
<div class="wp-image-5258 figure">
<img alt="" src="https://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/gmail-filter-steps.jpg?w=1024" />
</div>
<p><strong>To Python or not?</strong></p>
<p>I also considered Python tools for interfacing with gmail to accomplish this. There doesn't seem to be an easy way to group emails by &quot;Category&quot; in the <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python">Gmail API</a> or IMAP. IMAP is shorthand for <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol">Internet Message Access Protocol</a>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/imaplib.html">imaplib</a> is an &quot;IMAP4 protocol client&quot; in the Python standard library. Usually python's <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/smtplib.html">smtplib</a> is the first library that comes up for email. Don't forget about imaplib!

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Your life is a game of trade-offs. You spend x units of energy on x thing in order to gain something from it. You only have a limited number of energy and focus units.</p>
<p><strong>Each life interest you pursue comes with a cost per benefit units returned. Some examples of this might be:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>cooking vs. ordering food</li>
<li>family life, relationship, friends &amp; social life</li>
<li>job, income, career, financial planning</li>
<li>travel \ serendipity</li>
<li>skill development \ hobbies</li>
<li>home improvement \ DIY vs. hiring specialists</li>
<li>health choices \ exercising frequency</li>
<li>renting vs. buying a house</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these life choices require a certain amount of your energy and focus. So how do you determine the right balance?</p>
<p>It's good to start from the idea that nothing is given that you have to have. Some people eat take-out food instead of cooking. Lately I've preferred this as well. I know how to cook some things. But I know I can outsource the meal, pay a premium and enjoy great food. I am able to support my cravings for Taqueria Traspasada, even if it is more expensive. I want to leverage this trade-off to get a meal from someone who is a better cook than me. I also like supporting local businesses. All I have to do is pick it up from the restaurant. Plus it saves me the time spent shopping and preparing the meal, which I can use to write blog posts! 🤓 Or instead use the time to learn to speak German and French. J'habit a Chicago a Logan Square 👋</p>
<p>Some humans have no interest in seeing their family. Others are very tightly woven into the fabric of their kin. Introverts and extroverts will fall over the spectrum in what they deem an adequate social life. (But we're all pretty much even on this front in this pandemic world it seems.) Ultimately time given to others could be invested in yourself. However, humans are social animals and we benefit greatly from our bonds with our friends and family.</p>
<p>My point is that you should not assume that you have to be a good cook. But cooking is a rewarding and useful habit to cultivate. Maybe someday I'll get back into it more regularly!</p>
<p>You should pursue home improvement and DIY if it is interesting and fun to you. But I will hire a contractor if I ever need any work done on my home and leverage their specialization. Actually, I've avoided this choice altogether by renting an apartment instead of buying a house. I don't plan on buying a home anytime soon. That's my preference in this trade-off.</p>
<p>Renting instead of buying is also more conducive to my yearning for serendipity, which is a life more mobile and free with less rigid or even no employment. But right now I am greatly benefiting from stable employment with a successful company. Less vacation now is a trade for financial stability. But maybe someday I'll have both? Either way, someday I'll backpack the world. 🌍🌏🌎</p>
<p><strong>Relevant Economic Theory: The Law of Diminishing</strong><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_utility">Marginal Utility</a></p>
<p>In college, my economics professor likened this law to eating <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac">Big Macs</a> from McDonald's. The first Big Mac you eat gives you the most happiness units. The 2nd Big Mac gives you some happiness, but less than the first one because you are full. A 3rd Big Mac would give you even less happiness units. Hopefully you don't eat more than 3 Big Macs in one sitting, it won't give you very many happiness units. 😆</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Law Of Diminishing Marginal Utility states that all else equal as consumption increases the marginal utility derived from each additional unit declines. Marginal utility is derived as the change in&nbsp;utility&nbsp;as an additional unit is consumed. Utility is an economic term used to represent satisfaction or happiness.</p>
<ul class="simple">

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When allocating your energy and focus units, keep in mind this law. Maybe going out with your friends more than once a week gives you diminishing marginal utility. Maybe those units will be better spent on other activities and will bring greater joy per energy unit spent.</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion,</strong> carefully consider all of these trade-offs when designing your ideal life. Be cautious of putting too much of your energy and focus units into any one of these. But there's no right or wrong balance. The key is to think about your preferences, seek them out and constantly re-evaluate your trade-off decisions. Consider deeply what you really want and run towards it.</p>

<p><strong>Table Positioning for a Join</strong></p>
<p>&quot;In general, your smaller table should be the &quot;left&quot; table when joining two tables.&quot;... Professor demonstrates better performance by making the smaller table the &quot;outer&quot; table in a join.</p>
<p><strong>Block Nested Loop Join [</strong><a class="reference external" href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/nested-loop-joins.html#:~:text=A%20Block%20Nested%2DLoop%20(BNL,inner%20loops%20must%20be%20read.&amp;text=The%20join_buffer_size%20system%20variable%20determines,used%20to%20process%20a%20query.">mysql example</a><strong>]</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&quot;The brute force approach&quot;</li>
<li>If you have enough memory to hold a large table, a good option for joining.</li>
<li>Always pick the smaller table as the outer table.</li>
<li>Buffer as much of your outer table in memory as possible to reduce redundant I/O.</li>
<li>Loop over the inner table or use an index.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Index Nested Loop Join [</strong><a class="reference external" href="https://www.cs.carleton.edu/faculty/dmusicant/cs347f03/proj3/">CS Course definition</a><strong>]</strong></p>
<p>If indexes are available, or you could create an index to use for a join.</p>
<p><strong>Sort-Merge Join [</strong><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort-merge_join">wikipedia</a><strong>]</strong></p>
<p>Useful if one or both tables are sorted on a join key. Maximize sequential I/O.</p>

<p>How should the DBMS represent the database in storage files on disk? Solve it by choosing the right <em>storage model</em> for your target <em>workload</em>. The right strategy varies if you are reading data, writing data and with how many joins you are performing.</p>

<div class="section" id="workload-characterization">
<h2>Workload Characterization</h2>
<p><strong>OLTP</strong> (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing">Online Transaction Processing</a>): &quot;Simple queries with lots of writes.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>OLAP</strong> (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing">Online Analytical Processing</a>): &quot;Read only queries. Lots of joins. Doing a lot of reads, but they're more complex.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>HTAP</strong> (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_transactional/analytical_processing">Hybrid Transactional Analytical Processing</a>): &quot;is trying to do both of them. You still want to ingest new data, but analyze it as it comes in. It's used for companies making decisions on the fly as people are browsing websites, like internet advertising companies.&quot;</p>

<strong>Terminology Clarification</strong>: I will refer to &quot;items&quot; or &quot;data&quot; throughout this post. This could be substituted for contacts or whatever data you are looking for. For example, you might be fetching a page of contacts from your CRM. Or fetching your tweets from Twitter's API. Or searching the Google location API, you might look up an address and return geo-location coordinates.</blockquote>
<div class="section" id="api-http-lingo-you-should-know">
<h2>API &amp; HTTP Lingo You Should Know</h2>
<p><strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</strong></p>
<p>Per <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP">Mozilla</a>,&quot;Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model">client-server model</a>, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
HTTP: you = client. API = way to communicate with server</blockquote>
<p><strong>Application Programming Interface (API)</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">Per Wikipedia</a>, the purpose of an API is to simplify &quot;programming by <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(software_engineering)">abstracting</a> the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developer needs.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Representational State Transfer (REST)</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> is an architectural style of web APIs. It is the dominant architecture that many APIs use. Simple Object Access Protocol (<a class="reference external" href="https://smartbear.com/blog/test-and-monitor/soap-vs-rest-whats-the-difference/">SOAP</a>) is another style I've heard of, but it seems less common nowadays.</p>
<p>A REST API is built for interoperability and has properties like: &quot;simplicity of a uniform interface&quot; and &quot;visibility of communication between components by service agents.&quot; [<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">Wikipedia</a>] If an API follows REST, it has many good principles baked in.</p>
<p><strong>``GET``, ``POST`` and ``PATCH``</strong></p>
<p>These are three common types of request methods.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">GET</tt>: &nbsp;Read data returned, such as all of your tweets in <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs">the Twitter API</a>.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">POST</tt>: Create a new item, like writing a new tweet. Can also update existing data. Tweets aren't editable though!</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">PATCH</tt>: Similar to <tt class="docutils literal">POST</tt>, this is typically used for updating data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>URL or &quot;endpoint&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The website location to send your request</p>
<p><strong>URL Parameters</strong></p>
<p>Values you pass to tell the API what you want. They are defined by the API specifications, which are usually <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.activecampaign.com/reference">well documented</a>. In python's <tt class="docutils literal">requests</tt> library, they may be passed as <a class="reference external" href="https://treyhunner.com/2018/04/keyword-arguments-in-python/">keyword arguments</a>. Sometimes they are passable directly within the endpoint url string.</p>
<p><strong>Body or &quot;payload&quot;</strong></p>
<p>To make a request, you send a payload to the url. Often this is a JSON string with the API's URL parameters and values, AKA the request body. If the <a class="reference external" href="https://jira.readthedocs.io/">API is written specifically for Python</a>, it might accept an actual Python dictionary.</p>
<p><strong>Javascript Object Notation (JSON)</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnAyziNnuI0">JSON</a> is the data interchange standard for all languages. Usually it is the default way to pass data into and receive data from an API. If making a&nbsp; <tt class="docutils literal">POST</tt>, you can check your json object is formatted correctly by using a <a class="reference external" href="https://jslint.com/">json linter</a>. Or try Python's <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#module-json.tool">json.tool</a>! You can also pretty print your JSON or python dictionary with the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html">pprint</a> module. If you're using json.dumps remember it has <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html">pretty printing accessible by keyword arguments</a>! These features are accessible in the standard library. Isn't Python great? See also: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2020/09/15/python-101-an-intro-to-working-with-json/">Python 101 - An Intro to Working with JSON</a></p>
<p><strong>Headers</strong></p>
<p>These usually contain website cookies and authorization info. They also may tell the API what kind of data you want back. JSON and XML are the two most common types of data to return. You can specify the return format in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">content-type</span></tt> headers.</p>
<blockquote>
If you need to parse an XML response, check out Python's stock <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html">ElementTree API</a>. I've only seen a few APIs using XML responses, such as the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/">USPS Address Validation API</a>.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Authorization</strong></p>
<p>Authorization varies widely. This is the level of identification you need to pass to the API to make a request. Public APIs might require none. Some just need a username and password. Others use the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">Oauth standard</a>, which is a system involving credentials and tokens for extra security.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Authorization Scheme Example [</strong><a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization">Mozilla</a><strong>]</strong></p>
<p>Authorization: &lt;auth-scheme&gt; &lt;authorisation-parameters&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
# headers python dict example
headers = {&quot;Authorization&quot;: f&quot;basic {token}&quot;}
</pre>
<p><strong>Pages</strong></p>
<p>API data is commonly returned in multiple pages when there is a lot of data returned. Each page can be accessed one request at a time. Sometimes you can specify how many items you want on a page. But there is usually a maximum items per page limit like 100.</p>
<p><strong>Status code</strong></p>
<p>Each request usually gives you a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">numeric code corresponding to happened</a> when the server tried to handle your request. There is also usually a message returned.</p>
<p><strong>See also: Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI, pronounced &quot;Wis-Ghee&quot;)</strong></p>
<p>&quot;As described in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/">PEP3333</a>, the Python Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) is a way to make sure that web servers and python web applications can talk to each other.&quot;&nbsp; <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/install.html">Gunicorn</a> is one of <a class="reference external" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/deploying/wsgi-standalone/#uwsgi">a few Python WSGI clients</a>. <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/04/30/useful-links-for-web2py-beginners/">web2py</a> is another WSGI client and web framework I have used.</p>

<div class="section" id="creating-the-request-json">
<h2>Creating the Request JSON</h2>
<p>I recommend using <a class="reference external" href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> in most cases, depending on the complexity of the API. If the JSON syntax is straightforward, you can format your data as a python dictionary, then convert it to a JSON object with <tt class="docutils literal">json.dumps</tt> from the standard library's <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.dumps">json module</a>. But JSON can be tricky sometimes. You may also need to pass a dictionary of HTTP headers.</p>
<p>Some APIs have &quot;Postman Collections&quot;, a set of Python (or any language) script templates for the API. In those cases, it might make sense to use those resources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Path One: Make HTTP request with json &amp; requests libraries</strong></p>
<p>Format Python dict with <tt class="docutils literal">json.dumps</tt> from the standard library's <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.loads">json module</a>.&nbsp; Infer API requirements from documentation. Use requests for HTTP.</p>
<p><strong>Path Two: Make HTTP request with Postman &amp; requests library</strong></p>
<p>Use Postman to generate the JSON payload. Plug headers and payload into requests. Use requests library for HTTP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Postman has a friendly interface for plugging in all your pieces and tinkering with your request body until it works. Make it easier on yourself and use Postman, especially if there are collections. An alternative is to troubleshoot in Python if you are confident in your grasp of the API. I use both options depending on my familiarity with the API at hand.</p>
<p>Once you have the request working, you may <a class="reference external" href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/sending-api-requests/generate-code-snippets/">export your Postman request to almost any language</a>. For Python, you can sometimes export to the <tt class="docutils literal">requests</tt>,&nbsp; <tt class="docutils literal">http.client</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">urllib</tt> libraries. Hit the &quot;code&quot; button in Postman and then copy your code.</p>
<blockquote>
If you choose not to use Postman, you can use the json library. See the use of <tt class="docutils literal">json.dumps()</tt>to convert a dictionary to a JSON object in Example #2 below</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="formatting-your-request">
<h2>Formatting Your Request</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Paste your Postman headers, payload and url into your existing code.</li>
<li>You may want to use a dict or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2020/04/07/python-101-working-with-strings/">string formatting</a> to pass values to your request parameters or url.</li>
<li>If the API uses a token or other form of authorization that needs to be refreshed intermittently, I usually have a function that returns a token. <tt class="docutils literal">token = fetch_token()</tt> Then put the token in the headers dict.&nbsp; <tt class="docutils literal">{&quot;Authorization&quot;: f&quot;basic <span class="pre">{token}&quot;}</span></tt> Finally pass your headers and payload to your&nbsp; <tt class="docutils literal">requests.get</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">requests.request</tt> function along with the endpoint url.

<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">Status codes</a> are your friend. They offer a hint at why your request is not working. If you see 200 or 201, that's a good sign. They're usually helpful, but sometimes they can be misleading.</li>
<li>Ensure you are defining the correct content-type. I had an experience where Postman defined two conflicting <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">content-type</span></tt> headers and it <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-code-generators/issues/215">caused my request to fail</a>. The server's error message indicated the problem was in my JSON, so it took me a while to figure out the headers were the problem.</li>
<li>Sometimes it makes a difference if your url has <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://</span></tt> vs. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">https://</span></tt> in it.

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>I remember APIs seemed mysterious and daunting before I had used them. But like all things, they can be conquered with knowledge, understanding and tenacity to keep trying until you figure it out. Good luck!</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p><strong>Preface</strong></p>
<p>I always enjoy reading when technical people share their stories of the times things went a little haywire. Times when, despite their best intentions, a solution didn't work as planned and it ends in unpleasant or catastrophic failure. I had an experience like this recently, so here's my &quot;oops&quot; story. Fortunately, I think this falls closer to the unpleasant end of the spectrum.</p>
<p><strong>Finding A Solution</strong></p>
<p>My employer needed a way to create postcard contact lists to mail 500,000 people each month. About 2 years in with the company, the old postcard system was breaking down and no one knew how to fix it. The guy who built it left the company. I never knew him and he didn't leave behind much help for anyone to fix his creation.</p>
<p>For my team, it was easier to create the contacts lists by drawing contact data out of our CRM with <a class="reference external" href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/">requests</a> and formatting the data with <a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html">pandas</a>. So that's what I did to help us deliver the postcards. (Let's set aside the debate on the strategic value of postcards.)</p>
<p>Things were going smooth for a few months. The new system was creating the lists and nothing appeared to change. The system is still in use today we are more reliable than the old system in its partially degraded state. But there were some growing pains.</p>
<p><strong>The Moment of</strong> <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/jamesorharry/status/1100717726547562503">Ely</a></p>
<blockquote>
ELY (n.) The first, tiniest inkling you get that something, somewhere, has gone terribly wrong. [Douglas Adams, The Meaning of Liff]</blockquote>
<p>We began to hear murmurs of the same contacts getting mailed each month from our senders. The script was supposed to draw a certain allocation of contacts at random for each sender. I knew I used <tt class="docutils literal">`df.sample(n=1)</tt> &lt;<a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sample.html">https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.sample.html</a>&gt;`__ from pandas to randomize the contact pool. The contacts were definitely getting randomized.</p>
<p>Then one day while making a change requested by our stakeholders, I noticed some code I had written that looked sort of like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def remove_duplicates(df):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Remove duplicates and randomize the order of the rows.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    original = df.copy(deep=True)
    df = format_for_duplicate_removal(df)
    df = df.drop_duplicates().sample(n=1)
    deduped_contacts = original[original.index.isin(df.index)]
    return deduped_contacts
</pre>
<p><strong>The idea of this function was to:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>create a throwaway copy of the original dataframe with <tt class="docutils literal">df.copy()</tt></li>
<li>format the throwaway for better duplicate removal</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">drop_duplicates()</tt> and randomize the dataframe's order of the rows with <tt class="docutils literal">df.sample(n=1)</tt></li>
<li>return those rows from the original dataframe, preserving original data but in randomized order</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Discovering The Error</strong></p>
<p>Looks great, right? Can you spot my error? Here's where I went wrong: I needed to randomize the data that gets returned. But instead, I randomized the throwaway dataframe. I never once altered the order of the original table. I did remove the duplicates, but the row order of the original dataframe never changed.</p>
<p><strong>Assessing the Damage</strong></p>
<p>It took me a few months after I wrote the code to realize. That was enough time for a small fraction of our customers to get postcard bombed.</p>
<p>Suppose you have two postcard campaigns every month. Both campaigns are drawing from the same contact source data. Both lists are created by the same script with nearly the same logic. That's ok if you randomize the contact order or the list is static. But if you don't randomize them and it's supposed to be a &quot;random&quot; draw campaign, that means you'll likely end up sending to the same people in both campaigns. That's exactly what happened. I accidentally postcard bombed 'em.</p>
<p>Thankfully, only a small percent of our &quot;senders&quot; were opted into both campaigns. What does that mean for those senders? Their contacts got <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSPewc--3yY">NFL blitzed</a> for 3 months straight. Instead of getting 1 or maybe 2 postcards a month if they're really lucky, they received 2 a month, each month until I caught the error. We bombarded about 3,000 lucky potential customers each month during that time. Some of them let us know they thought it was excessive.</p>
<blockquote>
The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference. - Elie Wiesel</blockquote>
<p><strong>Sidebar On Analog Marketing</strong></p>
<p>I think postcards are still relevant as a Marketing tool in 2020. From an environmental perspective, I prefer going digital. Some people let us know when we mail them that they feel the same way and then we stop mailing them. But I think there's something tangible about real things you can hold in your hands. Postcards also tend to get a reaction, even if it's not a good one. Sometimes that reaction is an email stating, &quot;DON'T EVER MAIL ME AGAIN!!!&quot; 😆</p>
<p><strong>For the record, I changed my mistake to this:</strong></p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def remove_duplicates(df):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Remove duplicates and randomize the order of the rows.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    original = df.copy(deep=True)
    df = format_for_duplicate_removal(df)
    df = df.drop_duplicates()
    deduped_contacts = original[original.index.isin(df.index)]
    randomized_contacts = deduped_contacts.sample(n=1)
    return randomized_contacts
</pre>
<p><strong>Or maybe something like this would be better, for clearer separation of actions:</strong></p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def remove_duplicates(df):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Remove duplicates while preserving original data.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    original = df.copy(deep=True)
    df = format_for_duplicate_removal(df)
    df = df.drop_duplicates()
    deduped_contacts = original[original.index.isin(df.index)]
    return deduped_contacts

def randomize_contacts(df):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Randomize the order of the rows.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    randomized_contacts = df.sample(n=1)
    return randomized_contacts
</pre>
<p><strong>In Conclusion: Mistakes Happen.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes they have interesting consequences when you make them at a certain scale. Maybe I could have written some tests to prevent this. Maybe I should have reviewed my code a couple more times. Sometimes, we're asked to do work that stretches our mental capacity and time to the limit.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's almost always a better choice to use an existing system, rather than writing your own. But in this case, my team was put in a situation where we needed to deliver because some else's software wasn't doing the job. I did my best to fill that need. And we're still using this way to send postcards today.</p>
<p>I wish this failure didn't happen for the sake of everyone involved, but <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Essay_on_Criticism">to err is human</a>, right? Live and learn.</p>
