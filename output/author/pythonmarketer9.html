                </h2>

                
                

                <p>The basis of many great programs revolve around a simple set of operations:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Open a file.</li>
<li>Do something with the file contents.</li>
<li>Save the new file for the user.</li>
</ol>
<p>Python is nice and simple for this.&nbsp;Paste the below lines into a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=text+editor&amp;oq=text+edit&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.2054j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">text editor</a> and save as a .py file. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki/Python-&amp;-pip-Windows-installation">You need to have Python 3 installed</a>. In the same folder as your .py file, save a .txt file with some words in it. Alright, let's write some code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span>
<span class="normal">2</span>
<span class="normal">3</span>
<span class="normal">4</span>
<span class="normal">5</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><span class="n">file_name</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">input</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Enter your file name. e.g. words.txt&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">file_handle</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">file_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;r&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">lines</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">file_handle</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">readlines</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="nb">print</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">lines</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">file_handle</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">close</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div></td></tr></table></div>
<p>In line 1, we ask the user to enter their file name with Python's raw_input function. When the program runs, the user enters their text file name with extension. This line stores the name in a variable called file_name.</p>
<p><strong>In line 2,</strong> we open your text file and store it in a variable I have named file_handle. Think of the file handle as a bridge between your code and the text file. Quick point about the 'r' above: that tells the program to open the file in &quot;Read&quot; mode. There are several different file modes in programming. Some modes are just for reading an existing file, some are just for writing a new file, and some are capable of both. <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16208206/confused-by-python-file-mode-w/16208298">This Stack Overflow post</a> is well written and details the differences between file modes. Once established, the file handle allows you to read the file's contents or write new contents to the file.</p>
<p><strong>In line 3,</strong>&nbsp;we are calling the .readlines() method on our file handle. This method takes the file contents and stores them, line by line, into a list named &quot;lines&quot;. An alternative method is .read(), which opens the file and stores its contents as one string. Try switching this out in place of&nbsp; .readlines() to check out the difference.</p>
<p><strong>In line 4,</strong> we are printing the stored lines to show them to the user. We now have the file contents, ready to be used however we please.</p>
<p><strong>In line 5</strong>, we are closing the file.</p>
<p>Below, we are going to write a new file using the with statement, which is generally accepted as the best way to read or write a file:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
with open(&quot;Notes.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot;) as fhand:
    fhand.write(&quot;Did you know whales can live up to 90 years?&quot;)
</pre>
<p>In line 1, we are using Python's input function to ask the user what to name the file and storing it in a variable named file_name.</p>
<p>In line 2,&nbsp; we are calling the open function again that we used in the first example, but this time, notice the &quot;w&quot;. This indicates that we are opening the file in &quot;write&quot; mode.</p>
<p>In line 3, we are calling the .write() method on our file handle, named save_file, and passing it our text to be saved in our new file.</p>
<p><strong>In line 4</strong>, we are closing the file, completing the creation of our new file in the same folder as our .py program file.</p>
<p>Your program is now ready to be run. Double-click your .py file to execute it.</p>
<p>Before learning Python, file operations were a mystery to me. It took me a while to understand this clearly, and I wanted to share. Once you master these basic file operations, programming gets to be a lot more fun. Do try it out for yourself :D</p>

                <p>Here is what I have deduced is the fastest way to get an app up and
running with Node.js. This requires some familiarity with using the
command line. I completed the Codeacademy course &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line">Learn The Command
Line</a>&quot;
before beginning with Node.js. I think it helped me better understand
what the commands are and what they do.</p>
<p>Download and install <a class="reference external" href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.JS</a> Open the node
command prompt. This was done on a windows machine.</p>
<p>First, create a folder for your app(s):</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
mkdir node_apps
</pre>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Change the command prompt directory to your app's folder:</div>
</div>
<pre class="code literal-block">
cd \app_name
</pre>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Creates json file for your app. Fill out applicable info or just hit enter until the file is created.</div>
</div>
<pre class="code literal-block">
npm init
</pre>
<p>Install express.js module in node.js:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
npm install express
</pre>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Install express-generator module in node.js:</div>
</div>
<pre class="code literal-block">
npm install express-generator -g
</pre>
<p>Create the structure for your app and all necessary folders. (views,
css, Javascript, routing, etc.)</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
express app_name
</pre>
<p>Ensure all app module dependencies are installed:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
npm install
</pre>
<p>Start your server and web app:</p>
<pre class="code literal-block">
npm start
</pre>
<p>Go to <a class="reference external" href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> in a browser. Port 3000 is the default port
of Express. Your app is live in dev environment.</p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I learned most of this from <a class="reference external" href="https://codeforgeek.com/express-complete-tutorial-part-1/">this great blog post</a>.</li>
<li>The above does not include a database integration. I integrated with
a MongoDB database by following a blog post that has since been removed from the internet.</li>
<li>This <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uFY60CESlM">YouTube video</a>
was also very helpful to me for figuring out MongoDB and Node.js integration.</li>
<li>An HTML shorthand language called jade (aka pug) comes stock within
Express.js. <a class="reference external" href="https://webapplog.com/jade/">Here's further reading</a>
on the pros and cons.</li>
<li>All of the above has been from my own studies. I do not claim
anything listed as the most efficient or best way to use Node.js.
This is what has worked for me over the past two days.</li>
<li>It feels good to whip up a nimble app environment that is capable of
producing and supporting world changing software; Node.js is used by
Netflix, PayPal, Microsoft and Uber.</li>

                <p>I'm finally coming around in my understanding of Javascript. Here are a few quick explanations to help you if you are new to it.</p>
<p><strong>Javascript</strong></p>
<p>The language of the web. Most commonly used as a complement to HTML and CSS to create an interactive website.</p>
<p><strong>JQuery</strong></p>
<p>A popular Javascript library with many powerful commands that are quick and easy to call.</p>
<p><strong>Node.JS</strong></p>
<p>Software that allows you to run Javascript from the command line without being connected to the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Express.JS</strong></p>
<p>A popular Node.JS framework.</p>
<p><strong>Angular</strong></p>
<p>A popular front-end Javascript web framework. There are many out there but this seems to be the one I've heard of the most.</p>
<p><strong>I've begun to see a pattern with programming languages:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Learn to execute the core building blocks like using variables, loops and functions.</li>
<li>Learn more advanced libraries, documentation and uses.</li>
<li>Consider using and learning web frameworks depending on what you're trying to do with the language.</li>
<li>Practice to hone your knowledge. Build things you like.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've also noticed that Javascript has been easier to learn than Python was for me, because it's not my first programming language.
The concepts are the same. The syntax can trip me up at times, but I'm currently flying through
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript">Codeacademy's Javascript courses</a>. Sometimes it even seems fun!</p>

                <p><strong>Algorithm: a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.</strong></p>
<p>I recently read &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Homo-Deus-Brief-History-Tomorrow/dp/0062464310">Homo Deus</a>&quot;, a book by Yuval Noah Harari. It explores the idea that humans may simply be algorithmic decision making systems.&nbsp;AKA self-aware, self-learning algorithms. There are many parallels between a human and a computer algorithm.</p>
<p>The author says there are organic (human) and non-organic (machine) algorithms. Non-organic algorithms will someday have far more capability than organic algorithms. In some cases, such as diagnosing medical conditions, they already do.</p>
<p>He also recaps the history of humanity, which was a trend towards Humanism, the misguided notion that humans can know themselves. The reality is that algorithms will likely know us better than we could ever know ourselves in the future, according to the author. Note: he is very well credentialed in his studies of human history.</p>
<p>Going forward, he predicts a shift from humanism towards dataism or techno-humanism. Basically, algorithms and data will know us better than we know ourselves. Therefore, machine algorithms will be better qualified to make decisions for us than ourselves. And many (if not all) of our choices will be made by powerful non-organic algorithms.</p>
<p>Everything we do, decided by a machine to maximize health, happiness, and optimal living. The idea of a human's entire life being driven by algorithms sounds dystopian to me, but the author makes a convincing case.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer. Below are some thoughts that may help you decide.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>What are your programming goals? Get a coding job? Create an app or website? Become more productive at your current job?</li>
<li>What is your current experience level? Are you starting fresh or do you already know a language or two?</li>
<li>Do you have money saved up? Otherwise, you might need to take out a loan.</li>
</ol>
<p>A computer science degree is typically most expensive. Coding bootcamps are a lower cost option
that pack a wide curriculum into a few weeks or months, but they can still be pricey. The cheapest
option is to take a piecemeal approach through various online courses.</p>
<p><strong>School Advantages</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Wholistic approach. You get the ins and outs of programming from a proven curriculum.</li>
<li>Community. You learn with other students and from experienced teachers.</li>
<li>Job placement. Often various schools and bootcamps will connect you to a company.</li>
<li>Credentials. You gain confidence and the backing of your skills by an established institution.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Downsides</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Tuition Money. A lot of what you need to know is available for free or cheap on the web.</li>
<li>Skill level match. Some bootcamps are oriented for beginners, others are more advanced. If you do a bootcamp, make sure it fits your skill level.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you want a coding job</strong>, school makes sense. The bootcamps look to be effective if you can
handle the up-front investment. It's possible to land a job without schooling but much tougher.
I am currently considering <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com/">Full Stack Academy</a>.
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.codingdojo.com/">Coding Dojo</a>. There are many out there. CodeAcademy is a popular route as well.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to make an app or website</strong>, the school or the non-school route may both work.
For the non-school route, the following languages are good places to start:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Web App or Website: HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript</li>
<li>Web App or Website Framework: Flask, Django, FastAPI, py4web, Ruby on Rails, React</li>
<li>iOS app: Swift plus Apple's Xcode environment, Beeware Python library</li>
<li>Android App: Java or Kotlin, Beeware</li>
<li>General Coding: Python or Ruby</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you want to be more productive at work</strong>, I recommend learning Python. More on Python and where
to start <a class="reference external" href="https://lofipython.com/marketer-slash-programmer/">here</a>. <a class="reference external" href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate the Boring Stuff With Python</a>
is a great resource for boosting your productivity also.</p>
<p>It's not easy to decide whether or not school is for you. I'm still unsure after a year and a half
of programming on the side. No matter what, continue to learn multiple languages and strive for
a better grasp of the ones you know. Good luck!</p>
<p><strong>My decision: continue self-study and learning online for free.</strong></p>
<p>As of 8 months after writing this post, I have concluded that learning for free online was the right
choice for me. I've achieved many of my programming goals in the last three years,
thanks to materials available from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python">Codeacademy</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python">Coursera</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3d-n41Tobw">YouTube</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1720421/how-to-concatenate-two-lists-in-python?rq=1">Stack Overflow</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">countless helpful resources,</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://pymotw.com/3/glob/index.html">interesting blogs</a>,
and <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html">documentation</a>. I've talked with others who need
the in-person assistance that a bootcamp offers to learn. Do what works for you. Good luck with your decision.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
<p>Several years later after writing this post, I was lucky enough to land a job where
I used Python and Excel for a living! I studied for free online intermittently about 4 years to achieve it.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>We move in cycles. Work, rest, re-energize, play, repeat. The rhythm of
life.</p>
<p>I began my coding endeavors in the fall of 2015. After 6 months of
steady <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/03/11/random-findings/">coding practice and studying</a>, I
went from no knowledge to a basic hobbyist programmer capable of
creating a website with the help of <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/03/03/starting-to-almost-kinda-think-about-creating-a-web-app/">a framework</a>.
I published a few of my own primitive apps. Then I relapsed. Coding and
my full-time job wore me out. I stayed away from coding for about 6
months.</p>
<p>My ultimate goal to learn to code was to be able to build my own
websites and apps. I've done that now. I've found ways to do it more
efficiently, which I will share in future posts.</p>
<p>Two of my recent moonshot projects were Social Queues, a social playlist
builder for Spotify and Dropcycle, a bicycle on demand pick-up service.
Neither went anywhere, or really were that good of ideas, but I was able
to get to bare minimum viable product status, with little to no code.
Sites like <a class="reference external" href="http://carrd.co">carrd.co</a> work well to build a quick
landing page as proof of concept or landing page test. My favorite
project might be my <a class="reference external" href="http://tameimpala.pythonanywhere.com/tameimpala">Tame Impala website</a>,
which I used <a class="reference external" href="https://lofipython.com/getting-started-with-web2py/">web2py</a>
to build the site and <a class="reference external" href="http://pythonanywhere.com">pythonanywhere</a> to host for free.</p>
<p>My aspirations have shifted. Instead of just building apps, I want to
build apps that are useful to others and help me achieve financial
freedom and the ability to own my time.</p>
<p>I believe in cycles of learning. Similar to being in school: semester of
study, then time off to rest, then semester of study, more rest, etc.
The time away is as important as the time of study. Earlier this year, I
returned to programming and web development. After a long time of not
writing on this blog, I'm back at it. New cycle.</p>

                <p><strong>My First App is Live!</strong></p>
<p>Try it out here: <a class="reference external" href="http://tameimpala.pythonanywhere.com">tameimpala.pythonanywhere.com</a></p>
<p><strong>What It Does</strong></p>
<p>Ask it a question, and it queries a database of Tame Impala lyrics and pulls a response line from the lyrics
based on which words match up. Kevin Parker is the frontman of the band who writes 99% of Tame Impala songs.</p>
<p><strong>Evergreen Traffic</strong></p>
<p>When I first published the app in 2016, per Google Analytics it had 50 sessions from Google
and over 200 page views in 10 different countries after a few weeks.
In April 2025, the app received nearly 500 visits in traffic according to pythonanywhere.
Not too shabby from solely evergreen visits and with no promotion.</p>
<p><strong>SSL Certificates / Start SSL / PythonAnywhere&quot;</strong></p>
<p>An SSL certificate is required for the domain by PythonAnywhere to control the Admin page
and set up your app. You don't need this if your domain is &quot;username.pythonanywhere.com&quot;.</p>
<p>It was kind of tricky was figuring out how to set up the certificate for the first time.
<a class="reference external" href="https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/SSLOwnDomains">These instructions from PythonAnywhere</a> helped a lot.</p>
<p>I used a free certificate from Start SSL and it worked fine. If you're new to SSL like me,
here's a simple explanation: you get certificates aka two text files containing a long code
from your SSL provider and submit them to the domain host. The last step is to notify your
domain host and have them verify with the SSL provider. If all goes well, you'll be live in a few hours.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Masking&quot; domains</strong></p>
<p>This means if you type &quot;google.com&quot;, it will redirect to &quot;www.google.com&quot;.
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.godaddy.com/help/manually-forwarding-or-masking-your-domain-name-422">GoDaddy makes this super easy</a>.
I set it up for my site as well. <a class="reference external" href="https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/NakedDomains">Here's a post from PythonAnywhere</a> on this also.</p>
<p><strong>Collaborating with other programmers</strong></p>
<p>Currently trying to install and run GitHub on my Desktop. It's trickier to do on an outdated operating system.
Another programmer explained to me how it is the base means of collaboration and managing work flow for programmers
working together on a project. Probably will know more about this soon and <a class="reference external" href="https://lofipython.com/git-the-basics-a-git-version-control-cheat-sheet/">write a post on it</a>.
Git seems awesome and I had not been exposed to this tool until recently.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Most new skills I've tried to learn seem to follow a similar trajectory:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Stage One, Beginner's Thrill:</strong> A rapid growth and learning pace
at the beginning, because I'm conquering a lot of small goals, diving
into something new and there are rapid gains which feels great.</li>
<li><strong>Stage Two, Amateur's Reality:</strong> The pace of learning and
accomplishment levels off. I'm still learning, but the leaps forward
start following a plateau trajectory. This stage is not as rewarding
as the first. The key is to push through and jump to the next plateau
and keep improving.</li>
<li><strong>Stage Three, Mastery:</strong> This is the goal with most things I want
to learn, and if I gain enough experience and skill, I'll have the
ability to apply the new things I've learned to accomplish my goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is my own way of paraphrasing what I've read a million times on the
internet: put in the hours, stay focused and don't stop trying. Right
now I'm somewhere between stage one and two with Python. Gotta keep pushing
forward. (This blog is also serving as a pep talk to myself.)</p>
