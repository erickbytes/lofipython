                <p>Most new skills I've tried to learn seem to follow a similar trajectory:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stage One - Beginner's Thrill:</strong> A rapid growth and learning pace at the beginning, because I'm conquering a lot of small goals, diving into something new and there are rapid gains which feels great.</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="o">&lt;!--</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">--&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stage Two - Amateur's Reality:</strong> The pace of learning and accomplishment levels off. I'm still learning, but the leaps forward start following a plateau trajectory. This stage is not as rewarding as the first. The key is to push through and jump to the next plateau and keep improving.</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="o">&lt;!--</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">--&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<ul>
<li><strong>Stage Three - Mastery:</strong> This is the goal with most things I want to learn, and if I gain enough experience and skill, I'll have the ability to apply the new things I've learned to accomplish my goals.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is my own way of paraphrasing what I've read a million times on the internet - put in the hours, stay focused and don't stop trying. Right now I'm somewhere around stage one/two with Python. Gotta keep pushing forward. (This blog is also serving as a pep talk to myself.)</p>

                <p>Feeling really good about my progress with web2py. The tutorial videos are comprehensive, yet easy to understand. For a beginner, the "batteries included" philosophy that web2py has embraced is a godsend. This means everything you need to get creating comes stock. I <a href="http://www.web2py.com/init/default/download">downloaded the web2py program</a>, ran it, entered a password, and was immediately using a functional development interface.</p>
<p>web2py follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model - View - Controller software architecture</a> - which means it separates out the activities of programs into a few different layers (please forgive my oversimplified explanations):</p>
<ul>
<li>Model - Stores data / used in tutorial for database table creation (Written in Python)</li>
<li>Controller - Used to define page functions (Python)</li>
<li>Views - What the user sees (HTML/CSS/Javascript)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>(Image from web2py Documentation)</em></p>
<p><strong>If you're thinking about trying web2py here's a few things that I've really liked so far:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I have minimal knowledge outside of a few basic concepts of server operations. web2py provides a few simple lines of code that allows quick creation of a table (done in model) and corresponding form (done in controller/view) to add entries to the table and display form submissions elsewhere on your site.</li>
<li>Right now, I'm enjoying learning about the <a href="https://py4web.com/_documentation/static/en/chapter-05.html">Database Abstraction Layer (DAL),</a> which is pretty cool because you can rapidly run and test complex server queries within it.</li>
<li>It's set up for multiple applications, so I can create and play with several projects at once, whether simple applications or more complex websites.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 30 videos total on the web2py documentation page, and I've only watched 11 of them but have already learned a ton. The style of the Massimo Di Pierro is great because you often pick up on some golden nuggets of coding wisdom and programming tips while he walks you through the topic.</p>
<p>It's pretty sweet to be able to create and manipulate a website so quickly; still need to learn more, such as pick up CSS to really make it my own. But for now I'm happy for the many small accomplishments that have been easier to reach thanks to web2py.</p>

                    <a href="../choosing-a-web-development-path.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to &quot;Choosing a Web Development Path&quot;">Choosing a Web Development Path</a>
                </h2>

                
                

                <p>I have recently finished this <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/html">HTML course</a>, which recommends using cPanel to configure websites. So I bought a domain and registered with cPanel.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What I thought would happen in trying to create a website/app:</strong> Buy a domain and use cPanel and Python in perfect sync to create a website.</li>
<li><strong>Reality:</strong> cPanel is configured mostly for PHP. You can run Python scripts with it, but it doesn't seem to be the most effective route from what I've read.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I went back to the drawing board and I've simplified this down to two basic paths:</p>
<hr>
<p>Options      Languages                                                       Hosting                                         Framework / IDE
  <strong>Path 1</strong>   Build a website using Python + Python Web Frameworks and HTML   PythonAnywhere or other Python friendly hosts   <a href="http://www.web2py.com/">web2py</a>
  <strong>Path 2</strong>   Use a combo of HTML, Javascript + Python, other languages       cPanel, many other hosts                        None (AKA I'm not sure)</p>
<hr>
<p>I'm going with Path 1 because the only language I know is Python. I hope to learn other languages like Javascript and CSS but would like to get building as fast as possible.</p>
<p>I found a free web hosting service called PythonAnywhere. There are other <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/FreeHosts">free</a> and <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">paid</a> Python-friendly hosts that allow you to use Python.</p>
<p>Instead of the <a href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/03/03/starting-to-almost-kinda-think-about-creating-a-web-app/">previously mentioned web frameworks</a>, I've chosen web2py as a starter because of its compatibility with PythonAnywhere, its simplicity, easy to read documentation and relative ease of use for beginners.</p>
<p>+ A note on PythonAnywhere: they get 5 stars for the tutorial pictured below. It is very nice to see in the whirlwind of confusion of learning to deal with code and a new environment.</p>
<p><img alt="PythonAnywhere Tutorial" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-286" height="313" src="https://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/pythonanywhere-tutorial.jpg" width="1199"></p>
<p>++ Love this opening quote from <a href="http://web2py.com/book">web2py Documentation</a>: "I believe that the ability to easily build high quality web applications is of critical importance for the growth of a free and open society. This prevents the biggest players from monopolizing the flow of information."</p>
<p>+++ A note on web2py so far: <a href="http://www.web2py.com/init/default/documentation">the videos from the creator</a>, Massimo Di Pierro, are super useful!</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Wanted to also mention this <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/10/06/ide-guide/#nIvAMfNr_uqx">counterpoint against IDEs for beginners</a>: "Although many IDEs can handle more than one language, few do it well. Plus, it's likely overkill if you are just getting started."</p>
<p>"Finally, if you're just beginning Python, let me put in a plug for simple editors: it's best for you to learn the language and its libraries well writing it all yourself, and <em>then</em> if you think an IDE would speed your work along, use it. You'll find that you learn the language faster and more completely if you take this route." - <a href="http://pythoncentral.io/text-editors-vs-ides-for-python-development-selecting-the-right-tool/">Python Central</a></p>
<p>Ultimately your approach and tools used for any coding project depends on what you're trying to build, which language(s) used, and your own knowledge - and I'm still learning.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>One of my first goals when I started learning Python was to build a web application. Once you've gotten a basic grip on Python, you might be ready to learn about web frameworks. A web framework consists of software designed to aid in web development. They make it easier to create a website or web app - if you know how to use them. Unfortunately, there is a learning curve to using the frameworks but thankfully there is plenty o' documentation to go around to help you.</p>
<p>Here are the two <a href="https://www.airpair.com/python/posts/django-flask-pyramid">Python Frameworks</a> I've chosen to investigate (there are many out here on the webs):</p>
<ul>
<li>Django - widely used, great community support, comes with just about everything built in. Can be used for smaller apps or multi-page/app websites.</li>
<li>Flask - a "microframework" used for smaller apps. Possibly more manageable for someone beginning a smaller project (me!)</li>
</ul>
<p>So as a beginnerish-level coder, I've chosen to start with Flask; I also found <a href="http://opentechschool.github.io/python-flask/">this sweet guide</a> that I think will help. Maybe someday I will graduate to Django, it sounds like a great framework. I've also decided that first I need to <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design">brush up on my HTML</a> - And according to a lot of what I've read it doesn't hurt to know CSS/Javascript. So this whole "build a web app" idea will continue, albeit with some hurdles to clear first.</p>
<p>Edit: I ended up choosing web2py, which I hadn't even considered when I wrote this originally! Here's a <a href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/03/22/choosing-a-web-development-path/">post about why I chose it</a>.</p>

                <p>Python's set of libraries are fun to explore. They allow Python to work with many types of other coding languages, allow you to do cool stuff, and seem to require a minimal knowledge of the actual code. You can read the complete list of standard libraries <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/">here</a>. There are also others available that you can download and install for unique challenges or software such as <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Android">Android</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, my favorite library is <a href="http://thinkingtkinter.sourceforge.net/">Tkinter</a>. Tkinter is a module that replicates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">Tk/TCL</a> within Python and allows you to create a quick Graphical User Interface (GUI) for your programs - great for trying to put together a prototype program with basic aesthetic design control for things like buttons, entry boxes, text and other visual elements that make up the front end of a computer program.</p>
<p>+Pro Tip: When you're trying to use a new module, you can read how to use it in the module's documentation. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/tkinter.html">Here's Tkinter's documentation</a>.</p>

                <p>Tonight, I made a list of 15 things I've observed after 4 years of study at the University of Illinois and 4 years of professional experience in Marketing. So here they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's easier to sell one thing than several different products.</li>
<li>Distribution = Very Important (Duh!)</li>
<li>Marketing depends a lot on product quality - what can you do for the user/customer? What problems can you solve? <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2016/02/fit-and-finish.html">Seth Godin</a> talks about this quite often.</li>
<li>Design matters - in product, communications, and everything else in this world.</li>
<li>Sell benefits, not features.</li>
<li>People are emotional buyers.</li>
<li>The more you know about your customer, the better.</li>
<li>Budget and resources matter.</li>
<li>There can be an extremely wide variance from industry to industry - the key is to look for parallels.</li>
<li>Humanize your company as much as possible - <a href="http://members.cdbaby.com/shipping-confirmation.aspx">This is a great example</a>.</li>
<li>You're more likely to find success with talented people around you.</li>
<li>Be aware of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a> (The 80/20 Rule) - 80% of results often come from 20% of customers.</li>

                <p>Today's discovery is <a href="https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans">Python Koans</a>. According to <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/intro/learning/">python-guide.org</a>, Koans "uses a test-driven approach, q.v. TEST DRIVEN DESIGN SECTION to provide an interactive tutorial teaching basic Python concepts. By fixing assertion statements that fail in a test script, this provides sequential steps to learning Python."</p>
<p>I was also curious what a "Koan" actually is: "a paradox to be meditated upon that is used to train Zen Buddhist monks to abandon ultimate dependence on reason and to force them into gaining sudden intuitive enlightenment" - Merriam-Webster</p>
<p>Koans takes a little work to install. <a href="https://github.com/OmkarPathak/pygorithm">Pygorithm</a> is an similar package for learning advanced more algorithm theories with python, and can be more easily installed by <a href="https://github.com/OmkarPathak/pygorithm">pip</a>.</p>

                <p>I have studied and currently work in Marketing*, with around 5 years of experience. I would like to begin sharing my journey through the coding world. I have chosen Python as my language to explore, to start. I began last fall by completing three <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python">free online courses on Coursera</a> - taught by an amazing professor, Dr. Charles Severance from the University of Michigan. Check 'em out if you want an epic introduction to Python and coding in general.</p>
<p>I previously had a little bit of HTML experience - nothing else - so I am very new to coding and enjoying learning a little more every day. I'm going to post my trials, problems, and things I figure out along the way and anything else I find interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Why do I want to learn to program?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Rapidly growing segments of our lives rely on computers and similar technologies. It seems unwise to remain ignorant of their internal processes.</li>
<li>Web apps are cool, useful and make our lives better. I'd like to build them.</li>
<li>To strengthen myself professionally.</li>
<li>To CREATE - coding is actually a very great creative outlet.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why Python?</strong></p>
<p>It's a language that emphasizes readability, is very versatile and has a great community of users to help you solve problems. It can be used for everything from the front end - functionality, user interface, etc. to the back end - data storage, server use, etc.</p>
<p>My goal is to get better every day, and eventually build some cool shit.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading,</p>
<p>Erick</p>
<p>*At the time I wrote this, I worked in a non-techincal marketing role. I've since moved into a role where I use Python nearly every day. If you're wondering how, I use <a href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/05/12/pandas-pythons-excel-powerhouse/">Pandas</a>, <a href="https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/">Requests</a> and Excel a lot at my current gig.</p>
