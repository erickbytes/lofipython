                </h2>

                
                

                <p>In September 2021, I tested out the recommended ads runner, <a class="reference external" href="https://wordads.co/">WordAds</a>, on this WordPress blog. 6,182 ads were served over the course of a month, earning $0.86 from impressions and clicks. My average CPM or cost per thousand impressions was $0.14. My blog averages about 1,600 views a month at the moment, mostly fueled by various search engines. Here's an example of one ad that ran:</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Example Ad Run on This Site Shown Above</strong></p>
</div>
<p>In my WordPress account, I upgraded to the business plan. This gave me access to WordPress plug-ins. I enabled the <a class="reference external" href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/">Yoast SEO plug-in</a> and activated its site optimization. I also enabled the maximum ads possible in my settings. In spite of these efforts, the results were sparse. Maybe there's more that I could have done. But this blog is passive and more like a hobby at the moment. I'm ok with a blog that makes $0.86 per month. Maybe someday it will be worth more. But I enjoy writing so it's all good. My skills grow and maybe I share something with someone across the world. That's what keeps me coming back.</p>
<p>I concluded I will not be running ads anytime soon. I wanted to get a baseline of what I was leaving on the table by not running ads. Now I can project when I might tap into the blog's potential traffic revenue, if ever. It seems I would need much higher views per month before ads makes sense with my level of traffic, 65 blog followers and minor social media clout.</p>
<p>There's also the added benefit of not serving up people's data to ad companies. Ads seem to be a generally accepted way to earn from your internet labors. But right now, they're not for this blog. Good luck monetizing your blog. Or just writing for the hell of it!</p>
