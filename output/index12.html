                <p>Python's set of libraries are fun to explore. They allow Python to work with many types of other coding languages, allow you to do cool stuff, and seem to require a minimal knowledge of the actual code. You can read the complete list of standard libraries <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/">here</a>. There are also others available that you can download and install for unique challenges or software such as <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Android">Android</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, my favorite library is <a href="http://thinkingtkinter.sourceforge.net/">Tkinter</a>. Tkinter is a module that replicates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">Tk/TCL</a> within Python and allows you to create a quick Graphical User Interface (GUI) for your programs - great for trying to put together a prototype program with basic aesthetic design control for things like buttons, entry boxes, text and other visual elements that make up the front end of a computer program.</p>
<p>+Pro Tip: When you're trying to use a new module, you can read how to use it in the module's documentation. <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/tkinter.html">Here's Tkinter's documentation</a>.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Tonight, I made a list of 15 things I've observed after 4 years of study at the University of Illinois and 4 years of professional experience in Marketing. So here they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>It's easier to sell one thing than several different products.</li>
<li>Distribution = Very Important (Duh!)</li>
<li>Marketing depends a lot on product quality - what can you do for the user/customer? What problems can you solve? <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2016/02/fit-and-finish.html">Seth Godin</a> talks about this quite often.</li>
<li>Design matters - in product, communications, and everything else in this world.</li>
<li>Sell benefits, not features.</li>
<li>People are emotional buyers.</li>
<li>The more you know about your customer, the better.</li>
<li>Budget and resources matter.</li>
<li>There can be an extremely wide variance from industry to industry - the key is to look for parallels.</li>
<li>Humanize your company as much as possible - <a href="http://members.cdbaby.com/shipping-confirmation.aspx">This is a great example</a>.</li>
<li>You're more likely to find success with talented people around you.</li>
<li>Be aware of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a> (The 80/20 Rule) - 80% of results often come from 20% of customers.</li>
<li>Ads that annoy / shout about your product don't work; Ads that tell customers useful information or help them in some way do.</li>
<li>There is such a thing as too many choices for the customer - it overwhelms them.</li>
<li>Practice brevity. Whatever you've got to say, do it in fewer words.</li>
</ol>
<p>Agree? Disagree?</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Today's discovery is <a href="https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans">Python Koans</a>. According to <a href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/intro/learning/">python-guide.org</a>, Koans "uses a test-driven approach, q.v. TEST DRIVEN DESIGN SECTION to provide an interactive tutorial teaching basic Python concepts. By fixing assertion statements that fail in a test script, this provides sequential steps to learning Python."</p>
<p>I was also curious what a "Koan" actually is: "a paradox to be meditated upon that is used to train Zen Buddhist monks to abandon ultimate dependence on reason and to force them into gaining sudden intuitive enlightenment" - Merriam-Webster</p>
<p>Koans takes a little work to install. <a href="https://github.com/OmkarPathak/pygorithm">Pygorithm</a> is an similar package for learning advanced more algorithm theories with python, and can be more easily installed by <a href="https://github.com/OmkarPathak/pygorithm">pip</a>.</p>

                <p>I have studied and currently work in Marketing*, with around 5 years of experience. I would like to begin sharing my journey through the coding world. I have chosen Python as my language to explore, to start. I began last fall by completing three <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python">free online courses on Coursera</a> - taught by an amazing professor, Dr. Charles Severance from the University of Michigan. Check 'em out if you want an epic introduction to Python and coding in general.</p>
<p>I previously had a little bit of HTML experience - nothing else - so I am very new to coding and enjoying learning a little more every day. I'm going to post my trials, problems, and things I figure out along the way and anything else I find interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Why do I want to learn to program?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Rapidly growing segments of our lives rely on computers and similar technologies. It seems unwise to remain ignorant of their internal processes.</li>
<li>Web apps are cool, useful and make our lives better. I'd like to build them.</li>
<li>To strengthen myself professionally.</li>
<li>To CREATE - coding is actually a very great creative outlet.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why Python?</strong></p>
<p>It's a language that emphasizes readability, is very versatile and has a great community of users to help you solve problems. It can be used for everything from the front end - functionality, user interface, etc. to the back end - data storage, server use, etc.</p>
<p>My goal is to get better every day, and eventually build some cool shit.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading,</p>
<p>Erick</p>
<p>*At the time I wrote this, I worked in a non-techincal marketing role. I've since moved into a role where I use Python nearly every day. If you're wondering how, I use <a href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/05/12/pandas-pythons-excel-powerhouse/">Pandas</a>, <a href="https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/">Requests</a> and Excel a lot at my current gig.</p>
