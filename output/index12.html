                <p>Feeling really good about my progress with web2py. The tutorial videos are comprehensive, yet easy to understand. For a beginner, the &quot;batteries included&quot; philosophy that web2py has embraced is a godsend. This means&nbsp;everything you need to get creating comes stock. I <a class="reference external" href="http://www.web2py.com/init/default/download">downloaded the web2py program</a>, ran it, entered a password, and was immediately using&nbsp;a functional development interface.</p>
<p>web2py follows the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model - View - Controller software architecture</a>&nbsp;- which means it separates out the activities of programs into a few different layers (please forgive my oversimplified explanations):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Model - Stores data / used&nbsp;in tutorial for database table creation (Written in Python)</li>
<li>Controller - Used to define page functions (Python)</li>
<li>Views - What the user sees (HTML/CSS/Javascript)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>(Image&nbsp;from web2py Documentation)</em></p>
<p><strong>If you're thinking about trying web2py&nbsp;here's a few things that I've really liked so far:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>I have minimal knowledge outside of&nbsp;a few basic concepts of server operations. web2py provides a few simple lines of code that allows quick creation of a table (done in model) and corresponding form (done in controller/view) to add entries to the table and display form submissions elsewhere on your site.</li>
<li>Right now, I'm enjoying learning&nbsp;about the <a class="reference external" href="https://py4web.com/_documentation/static/en/chapter-05.html">Database Abstraction Layer (DAL),</a> which is pretty cool because you can rapidly run and test complex server queries within it.</li>
<li>It's set up for multiple applications, so I can create and play with&nbsp;several projects at once, whether simple applications or more complex websites.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are 30 videos total on the web2py documentation page, and I've only watched 11 of them but have already learned a ton. The style of the Massimo Di Pierro is great because you often pick up on some golden nuggets of coding wisdom and programming&nbsp;tips while he walks you through the topic.</p>
<p>It's pretty sweet&nbsp;to be able to create and manipulate a website so quickly; still need to learn more, such as pick up CSS to really make it my own. But for now I'm happy for the many small accomplishments&nbsp;that have been easier to reach thanks to web2py.</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>I have recently finished this <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/html">HTML course</a>, which recommends using cPanel
to configure websites. So I bought a domain and registered with cPanel.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>What I thought would happen in trying to create a
website/app:</strong>Buy a domain and use cPanel and Python in perfect
sync to create a website.</li>
<li><strong>Reality:</strong>cPanel is configured mostly for PHP. You can run Python
scripts with it, but it doesn't seem to be the most effective route
from what I've read.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I went back to the drawing board and I've simplified this down to two
basic paths:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="8%" />
<col width="40%" />
<col width="30%" />
<col width="23%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td>Options</td>
<td>Languages</td>
<td>Hosting</td>
<td>Framework / IDE</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><strong>Path 1</strong></td>
<td>Build a website using Python + Python Web Frameworks and HTML</td>
<td>PythonAnywhere or other Python friendly hosts</td>
<td><a class="reference external" href="http://www.web2py.com/">web2py</a></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><strong>Path 2</strong></td>
<td>Use a combo of HTML, Javascript + Python, other languages</td>
<td>cPanel, many other hosts</td>
<td>None (AKA I'm not sure)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I'm going with Path 1 because the only language I know is Python. I hope
to learn other languages like Javascript and CSS but would like to get
building as fast as possible.</p>
<p>I found a free web hosting service called PythonAnywhere. There are
other <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/FreeHosts">free</a> and paid Python-friendly hosts.</p>
<p>Instead of the <a class="reference external" href="https://lofipython.com/starting-to-almost-kinda-think-about-creating-a-web-app/">previously mentioned web frameworks</a>,
I've chosen web2py as a starter because of its compatibility with PythonAnywhere, its simplicity, easy to read documentation and relative
ease of use for beginners.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A note on PythonAnywhere: they get 5 stars for the tutorial pictured
below. It is very nice to see in the whirlwind of confusion of
learning to deal with code and a new environment.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="PythonAnywhere Tutorial" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-286" src="https://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/pythonanywhere-tutorial.jpg" style="width: 1199px; height: 313px;" />
<p>++ Love this opening quote from <a class="reference external" href="http://web2py.com/book">web2py Documentation</a>: &quot;I believe that the ability to easily build
high quality web applications is of critical importance for the growth
of a free and open society. This prevents the biggest players from
monopolizing the flow of information.&quot;</p>
<p>+++ A note on web2py so far: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.web2py.com/init/default/documentation">the videos from the creator</a>, Massimo Di
Pierro, are super useful!</p>

This article from Stack Overflow clarifies <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5255868/difference-between-ide-and-framework">the difference between an IDE and a web framework</a>.</p>
<p>&quot;Finally, if you're just beginning Python, let me put in a plug for simple editors:
it's best for you to learn the language and its libraries well writing it all yourself, and <em>then</em> if you think an IDE would speed your work along, use it.
You'll find that you learn the language faster and more completely if you take this route.&quot;

<p>Ultimately your approach and tools used for any coding project depends on what you're trying to build,
which language(s) used, and your own knowledge - and I'm still learning.</p>

                <p>One of my first goals when I started learning Python was to build a web application. Once you've gotten a basic grip on Python, you might be ready to learn about web frameworks. A web framework consists of software designed to aid in web development. They make it easier to create a website or web app - if you know how to use them. Unfortunately, there is a learning curve to using the frameworks but thankfully there is plenty o' documentation to go around to help you.</p>
<p>Here are the two <a class="reference external" href="https://www.airpair.com/python/posts/django-flask-pyramid">Python Frameworks</a> I've chosen to investigate:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Django - widely used, great community support, comes with just about everything built in. Can be used for smaller apps or multi-page/app websites.</li>
<li>Flask - a &quot;microframework&quot; used for smaller apps. Possibly more manageable for someone beginning a smaller project (me!)</li>
</ul>
<p>So as a beginnerish-level coder, I've chosen to start with Flask; I also found <a class="reference external" href="http://opentechschool.github.io/python-flask/">this sweet guide</a> that I think will help. Maybe someday I will graduate to Django, it sounds like a great framework. I've also decided that first I need to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design">brush up on my HTML</a> - And according to a lot of what I've read it doesn't hurt to know CSS/Javascript. So this whole &quot;build a web app&quot; idea will continue, albeit with some hurdles to clear first.</p>
<p>Edit: I ended up choosing web2py, which I hadn't even considered when I wrote this originally! Here's a <a class="reference external" href="https://lofipython.com/choosing-a-web-development-path/">post about why I chose it</a>.</p>

                <p>Python's set of libraries are&nbsp;fun to explore. They allow Python to work with many types of other coding languages, allow you to do cool stuff, and seem&nbsp;to require&nbsp;a minimal knowledge of the actual code. You can read the complete list of standard libraries <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/">here</a>. There are also others available that you can download and install for unique challenges or software such as <a class="reference external" href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Android">Android</a>.</p>
<p>Currently, my favorite library is <a class="reference external" href="http://thinkingtkinter.sourceforge.net/">Tkinter</a>. Tkinter is a module that replicates <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">Tk/TCL</a>&nbsp;within Python and&nbsp;allows you to create a quick Graphical User Interface (GUI) for your programs - great for trying to put together a prototype program with&nbsp;basic aesthetic design control&nbsp;for&nbsp;things like buttons, entry boxes, text and other visual elements that make up the front end of a computer program.</p>
<p>+Pro Tip: When you're trying to use a new module, you can read how to use it in the module's documentation. <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/tkinter.html">Here's Tkinter's documentation</a>.</p>

                <p>Tonight, I made a list of 15 things I've observed after 4 years of study
at the University of Illinois and 4 years of professional experience in
Marketing. So here they are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>It's easier to sell one thing than several different products.</li>
<li>Distribution = Very Important (Duh!)</li>
<li>Marketing depends a lot on product quality - what can you do for the
user/customer? What problems can you solve?
<a class="reference external" href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2016/02/fit-and-finish.html">Seth Godin</a> talks about this quite often.</li>
<li>Design matters - in product, communications, and everything else in
this world.</li>
<li>Sell benefits, not features.</li>
<li>People are emotional buyers.</li>
<li>The more you know about your customer, the better.</li>
<li>Budget and resources matter.</li>
<li>There can be an extremely wide variance from industry to industry -
the key is to look for parallels.</li>
<li>Humanize your company as much as possible - <a class="reference external" href="http://members.cdbaby.com/shipping-confirmation.aspx">This is a great example</a>.</li>
<li>You're more likely to find success with talented people around you.</li>
<li>Be aware of the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">Pareto Principle</a> (The 80/20 Rule)
- 80% of results often come from 20% of customers.</li>
<li>Ads that annoy / shout about your product don't work; Ads that tell
customers useful information or help them in some way do.</li>
<li>There is such a thing as too many choices for the customer - it
overwhelms them.</li>
<li>Practice brevity. Whatever you've got to say, do it in fewer words.</li>
</ol>

                <p>Today's discovery is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans">Python Koans</a>.&nbsp;According to <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/intro/learning/">python-guide.org</a>, Koans &quot;uses a test-driven approach, q.v. TEST DRIVEN DESIGN SECTION to provide an interactive tutorial teaching basic Python concepts. By fixing assertion statements that fail in a test script, this provides sequential steps to learning Python.&quot;</p>
<p>I was also curious what a &quot;Koan&quot; actually is: &quot;a paradox to be meditated upon that is used to train Zen Buddhist monks to abandon ultimate dependence on reason and to force them into gaining sudden intuitive enlightenment&quot; - Merriam-Webster</p>
<p>Koans takes a little work to install. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/OmkarPathak/pygorithm">Pygorithm</a> is a similar package for learning advanced more algorithm theories with python, and can be more easily installed by pip.</p>

                <p>I have studied and currently work in Marketing*, with around 5 years of experience. I&nbsp;would like to begin sharing my journey through&nbsp;the coding world. I have chosen Python as my language to explore, to start. I began last fall by completing three&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python">free online courses on Coursera</a> - taught by an amazing professor, Dr. Charles Severance from the University of Michigan. Check 'em out if you want an epic introduction to Python and coding in general.</p>
<p>I previously had a little bit of HTML experience - nothing else - so I am very new to coding and enjoying learning a little more every day. I'm going to post my trials, problems, and things I figure out along the way and anything else I find interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Why do I want to learn to program?</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Rapidly growing segments of our lives rely on computers and similar technologies. It seems unwise to remain ignorant of their internal processes.</li>
<li>Web apps are cool, useful and make our lives better. I'd like to build them.</li>
<li>To strengthen myself professionally.</li>
<li>To CREATE - coding is actually a very great creative outlet.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why Python?</strong></p>
<p>It's a language that emphasizes readability, is very versatile and has a great community of users to help you solve problems. It can be used for everything from the front end - functionality, user interface, etc. to the back end - data storage, server use, etc.</p>
<p>My goal is to get better every day, and eventually build some cool shit.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading,</p>
<p>Erick</p>
<p>*At the time I wrote this, I worked in a non-techincal marketing role. I've since moved into a role where I use Python nearly every day.
If you're wondering how, I use <a class="reference external" href="https://lofipython.com/pandas-pythons-excel-powerhouse/">Pandas</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api">Requests</a> and Excel a lot at my current gig.</p>
