                <p>Proud to announce my newest side project blog, Diversified Bullish, is live at <a class="reference external" href="http://divbull.com">divbull.com</a>. It is made with <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/quickstart.html#">Pelican</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jody-frankowski/blue-penguin/tree/311a5208c030ea62d85bbca952e31b6775a50c2c">Blue Penguin theme</a>. I'm planning to write about stocks and investing there moving forward in addition to this blog which focuses on Python programming.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/erickbytes/divbull/tree/main/divbull.com">divbull.com Github repo</a> serves the static files generated by Pelican via <a class="reference external" href="https://pages.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare pages</a>. It's free, unless you purchase a domain. I purchased my .com domain with <a class="reference external" href="https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9607/2210/how-to-set-up-dns-records-for-your-domain-in-cloudflare-account/">Namecheap</a> before I learned about Cloudflare pages. I followed <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started/">these instructions</a> to set up my new financial blog. If you're interested, you can subscribe to an <a class="reference external" href="https://divbull.com/feeds/all.atom.xml">RSS feed here</a> to follow when I post something new.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The dashboard provides a number of framework-specific presets. These presets provide the default build command and build output directory values for the selected framework. If you are unsure what the correct values are for this section, refer to <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/build-configuration/">Build configuration</a>. <strong>If you do not need a build step, leave the Build command field blank.</strong></p>

<p>Working in the Cloudflare pages build dashboard is sweet. It took me about 5 failed Pelican <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/build-configuration/">build commands</a> to get the site to deploy. Finally, I was able to get the site build to complete by leaving the build command blank. Cloudflare was able to scoop up my Pelican &quot;output&quot; folder contents and render the blog. How cool. I feel like I've done the impossible, launching a passable quality blog with top shelf tools this quickly for under $10!</p>
<p>Initially, I spent a few hours getting to know Pelican. Once I correctly installed a theme I liked, I banged out a few philosophical financial musings to give the blog some posts. Then I had the static files generated but no clue how to serve them. Enter Cloudflare pages, a free option to host a blog.</p>
<p>Connecting the repo to Cloudflare pages, adding the files to the repo and finding the correct build command added a few more hours. In total, it took me about 1-2 days to make a live site since I did not know about Pelican or Cloudflare pages when I began playing with a Pelican blog in April. This was my first static site launch!</p>

                <p>Making time to code can be done every day. Carve out those little moments where you can automate tedious tasks or study up on that <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm">hot new Python library</a> that takes your quality to another level.</p>
<p>Take time to reorganize and refactor in <a class="reference external" href="https://atom.io/">your favorite text editor</a>. Break your script, then break it again. Break it until it works. Absorb your new abilities as a machine literate human and build skills on top of skills. Make a breakthrough. The code is great. It makes sense. Another tweak here, another tweak there. Run <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psf/black">black</a> on it and then have a go at <a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/">PEP-8</a> to brush up on your style. More tweaks, and need to add some <a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/">docstrings</a> for more clarity.</p>
<p>Another one bites the dust. Who knows where your skills could grow. Following the code is a delightful road. Some days it's hard. Some days it's easy. But it's fulfilling if you treat it like a locksmith does keys. Knowledge is flowing. The craft is built in each moment. Challenges overcome. Battles won. New innovations to munge.</p>
<p>Code is the medium to communicate with machines and leverage their efficiency for convenient means. Tighter the web we weave with transistors and screens, the more we'll need dignified intermediaries of man and machine. Here's to the good code and the bad code we all will write. May we never let something stop our logical flights to code a better dream.</p>

                <p>Below are two practical Python libraries for text processing. This function uses <a class="reference external" href="https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/api_reference.html?highlight=correct#textblob.blob.TextBlob.correct">textblob's spelling correction</a> along with <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/language-tool-python/">language_tool_python</a>, which applies grammatical corrections via the <a class="reference external" href="https://languagetool.org/http-api/swagger-ui/#!/default/post_check">Language Tool API</a>. I added these text processing transformations into my <a class="reference external" href="https://www.positivipy.com/">concept text generation app</a>. These are free, public APIs up to around 20 requests per second. You can send both text and receive back an improved version of your text, ideally altering and improving your writing.</p>
<p>I found 2 errors when I piped the text of this post into the below code: the proper noun &quot;textblob&quot; corrected to &quot;text blow's&quot; and the word &quot;app&quot; corrected to &quot;pp&quot;. Be sure to proof your results. Regardless, I like having these two Python tools in my bag!</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Yesterday, I experienced a flow state where I became manically obsessed with perfecting a script I was working on. I think it's beautiful code, about 100 lines long without <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/">docstrings</a>. It solves a real need and it felt great to write it. Some scripts feel terrible to write and you know they're bad. However, this one felt like one of the best I've ever written.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Flow</a> seems like a mythical, unattainable state these days as portrayed in media, but we can all agree... we love it. When you're in flow, you know it and you feel a grace in improving your work. For coders, maybe it's by wrapping up a few lines here and there into functions. <a class="reference external" href="https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html">Refactoring</a>, reordering, handling loose ends or edge cases, writing docstrings with supporting documentation and clarifying that you really understand what's happening... these things are all mundane at times but critical to writing reliable code.</p>
<p>While doing these typical tasks, you're attaining skill and mastery, one of the highest dopamine hits humans can register legally in all 50 states. You know how much better this iteration of code is than when you first learned to write software. You take bits and pieces from past projects and fit them all together into a cohesive, purposeful program. For example, I was tickled to use Python's <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files">readlines() file reading function</a> to get the last line of a text file. I learned about this function in my first ever free <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python">Python course on Coursera</a>, 7 years ago. Thanks again Dr. Chuck!</p>
<p>This time, I realized my flow when researching <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 time format strings</a> and guiding them into an HTTP request with the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">requests library</a>. A new solution emerged, regurgitated from a prior project and mashed up into a more refined form to satisfy the project's requirements. I combined old and new ideas into a better solution than I had ever thought, a fitting complement for the <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.com/2020/05/18/how-to-make-json-requests-with-python/">API</a> at hand. Time will tell if the solution will actually work as well as I hope.</p>
<p>Flow is real. You can find work that puts you in a flow state, and it doesn't have to be super interesting work to get there. The learning process pays rewards in competency when exposure to different domains combine. Einstein knew a form of this as <a class="reference external" href="https://evernote.com/blog/einsteins-unique-approach-to-thinking/#:~:text=He%20viewed%20taking%20music%20breaks,come%20up%20with%20new%20ideas.">&quot;combinatory play&quot;</a>. Repetition enhances this effect and solidifies your foundation. Flow makes it fun! Only rarely do I feel the highest level of engrossment in my work. I sensed I was flowing on this recent project. You can find these types of challenges too. Keep searching for your flow!</p>

                <p>Every Python programmer has undoubtedly come across some crazy characters.

                <p>If you write Python code, there's probably been a time or two when you saw the dreaded <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#MemoryError">&quot;MemoryError&quot;</a>. This happens after one of your Python scripts stops because your computer has no spare <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a> to execute it. I recently experienced this frustration whilst trying to write hundreds of thousands of csv files. However, this time I grasped for tools that support smarter memory management. Now, I can watch my computer's memory bounce around with the Windows Resource Monitor. Python has quite a few memory profiling libraries for monitoring memory too!</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>When you'll see &quot;MemoryError&quot; depends on your computer's hardware, the size of your dataset and what operations you need to script out. Generally speaking, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output">I/O</a> or file reads and writes are more expensive operations.</p>
<p>The tools in this post will help you anticipate how much computing power you have available, monitor your memory consumption more closely and avoid pushing your computer past its limits. You can do things like reading data in chunks and only using the columns you need to reduce your memory consumption. Realizing these tools and strategies can make getting things done with Python a smoother ride.</p>

                <p>A static site generator creates static HTML and markdown files to serve as a website. They're commonly used to host blogs but not exclusively. I recently researched my options to roll a static site in Python. I'm assessing a few of them as a potential future self-hosted blogging solution for this Wordpress blog. Or maybe I'll spin up a new one!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Why Statics?</strong></p>
<p>Most &quot;modern&quot; websites are <em>dynamic</em> in the sense that the contents of the site live in a database, and are converted into presentation-ready HTML only when a user wants to see the page. That's great. However, it presents some minor issues that static site generators try to solve.</p>
<p>In a static site, the whole site, every page, <em>everything</em>, is created before the first user even sees it and uploaded to the server as a simple folder full of HTML files (and images, CSS, etc).</p>

                <p><strong>How do you calculate stock valuation metrics like</strong><a class="reference external" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp">Sharpe ratio</a><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>Recently I've been reading about common <a class="reference external" href="https://www.suredividend.com/ratios-metrics/">stock valuation metrics</a> and wondered how I can apply them to my stock portfolio. I started reading about different metrics, sketching formulas and entertained writing a script to calculate these metrics. But Python has no shortage of finance-related libraries. After some furious googling I found <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pmorissette/ffn">ffn</a>, a way better option than rolling my own formulas. It's a &quot;financial function&quot; library, installable with pip.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to observe how these metrics vary in my portfolio and learn more of <a class="reference external" href="http://pmorissette.github.io/ffn/ffn.html">ffn's API</a>. I like that they use <a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html">pandas dataframes</a> within their library because I'm already familiar with them. At minimum, it's good to understand what stock formulas purport to measure and what it means if the measure is low or high. It makes sense to compare stocks in similar industries or competitors like <a class="reference external" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NKE/">NKE</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ADDYY?p=ADDYY&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch">ADDYY</a>. This is a neat tool for stock nerds who want to level up their stock analysis, make smart decisions and ideally pad the portfolio!</p>
<p>The funny thing is... my lowest university grade was a &quot;C&quot; in my only Finance class. It wasn't easy for me to grasp. But with Python it's a little more interesting and easier to apply. Anyone can level up their finance skills thanks to a cornucopia of finance calculation libraries in the Python ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>side note on the pyfolio library</strong></p>
<p>I first considered using pyfolio to pull stock data. It is not &quot;out of the box&quot; ready per se to deliver the results pictured in their <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2021/01/16/pick-stocks-like-a-pro-with-pyfolio/">&quot;single stock&quot; example</a> documentation. You'd need to find another way to fetch your market data or somehow patch the Yahoo Finance API within pyfolio. I preferred <a class="reference external" href="http://pmorissette.github.io/ffn/quick.html">ffn</a>, mostly because it worked right away after pip installing it and running the above code.</p>
<p><strong>2023 Update:</strong> ffn and pyfolio depend on the Yahoo Finance API, which changes sometimes break these libraries. Troubleshooting traceback errors may be required.</p>

<strong>Terminology Clarification</strong>: I will refer to &quot;items&quot; or &quot;data&quot; throughout this post. This could be substituted for contacts or whatever data you are looking for. For example, you might be fetching a page of contacts from your CRM. Or fetching your tweets from Twitter's API. Or searching the Google location API, you might look up an address and return geo-location coordinates.</blockquote>
<div class="section" id="api-http-lingo-you-should-know">
<h2>API &amp; HTTP Lingo You Should Know</h2>
<p><strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</strong></p>
<p>Per <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP">Mozilla</a>,&quot;Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model">client-server model</a>, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response.&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
HTTP: you = client. API = way to communicate with server</blockquote>
<p><strong>Application Programming Interface (API)</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">Per Wikipedia</a>, the purpose of an API is to simplify &quot;programming by <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction_(software_engineering)">abstracting</a> the underlying implementation and only exposing objects or actions the developer needs.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Representational State Transfer (REST)</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> is an architectural style of web APIs. It is the dominant architecture that many APIs use. Simple Object Access Protocol (<a class="reference external" href="https://smartbear.com/blog/test-and-monitor/soap-vs-rest-whats-the-difference/">SOAP</a>) is another style I've heard of, but it seems less common nowadays.</p>
<p>A REST API is built for interoperability and has properties like: &quot;simplicity of a uniform interface&quot; and &quot;visibility of communication between components by service agents.&quot; [<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">Wikipedia</a>] If an API follows REST, it has many good principles baked in.</p>
<p><strong>``GET``, ``POST`` and ``PATCH``</strong></p>
<p>These are three common types of request methods.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">GET</tt>: &nbsp;Read data returned, such as all of your tweets in <a class="reference external" href="https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs">the Twitter API</a>.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">POST</tt>: Create a new item, like writing a new tweet. Can also update existing data. Tweets aren't editable though!</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">PATCH</tt>: Similar to <tt class="docutils literal">POST</tt>, this is typically used for updating data.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>URL or &quot;endpoint&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The website location to send your request</p>
<p><strong>URL Parameters</strong></p>
<p>Values you pass to tell the API what you want. They are defined by the API specifications, which are usually <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.activecampaign.com/reference">well documented</a>. In python's <tt class="docutils literal">requests</tt> library, they may be passed as <a class="reference external" href="https://treyhunner.com/2018/04/keyword-arguments-in-python/">keyword arguments</a>. Sometimes they are passable directly within the endpoint url string.</p>
<p><strong>Body or &quot;payload&quot;</strong></p>
<p>To make a request, you send a payload to the url. Often this is a JSON string with the API's URL parameters and values, AKA the request body. If the <a class="reference external" href="https://jira.readthedocs.io/">API is written specifically for Python</a>, it might accept an actual Python dictionary.</p>
<p><strong>Javascript Object Notation (JSON)</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnAyziNnuI0">JSON</a> is the data interchange standard for all languages. Usually it is the default way to pass data into and receive data from an API. If making a&nbsp; <tt class="docutils literal">POST</tt>, you can check your json object is formatted correctly by using a <a class="reference external" href="https://jslint.com/">json linter</a>. Or try Python's <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#module-json.tool">json.tool</a>! You can also pretty print your JSON or python dictionary with the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html">pprint</a> module. If you're using json.dumps remember it has <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html">pretty printing accessible by keyword arguments</a>! These features are accessible in the standard library. Isn't Python great? See also: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2020/09/15/python-101-an-intro-to-working-with-json/">Python 101 - An Intro to Working with JSON</a></p>
<p><strong>Headers</strong></p>
<p>These usually contain website cookies and authorization info. They also may tell the API what kind of data you want back. JSON and XML are the two most common types of data to return. You can specify the return format in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">content-type</span></tt> headers.</p>
<blockquote>
If you need to parse an XML response, check out Python's stock <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html">ElementTree API</a>. I've only seen a few APIs using XML responses, such as the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/">USPS Address Validation API</a>.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Authorization</strong></p>
<p>Authorization varies widely. This is the level of identification you need to pass to the API to make a request. Public APIs might require none. Some just need a username and password. Others use the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">Oauth standard</a>, which is a system involving credentials and tokens for extra security.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Authorization Scheme Example [</strong><a class="reference external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization">Mozilla</a><strong>]</strong></p>
<p>Authorization: &lt;auth-scheme&gt; &lt;authorisation-parameters&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<pre class="literal-block">
# headers python dict example
headers = {&quot;Authorization&quot;: f&quot;basic {token}&quot;}
</pre>
<p><strong>Pages</strong></p>
<p>API data is commonly returned in multiple pages when there is a lot of data returned. Each page can be accessed one request at a time. Sometimes you can specify how many items you want on a page. But there is usually a maximum items per page limit like 100.</p>
<p><strong>Status code</strong></p>
<p>Each request usually gives you a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">numeric code corresponding to happened</a> when the server tried to handle your request. There is also usually a message returned.</p>
<p><strong>See also: Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI, pronounced &quot;Wis-Ghee&quot;)</strong></p>
<p>&quot;As described in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/">PEP3333</a>, the Python Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) is a way to make sure that web servers and python web applications can talk to each other.&quot;&nbsp; <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/install.html">Gunicorn</a> is one of <a class="reference external" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/deploying/wsgi-standalone/#uwsgi">a few Python WSGI clients</a>. <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/04/30/useful-links-for-web2py-beginners/">web2py</a> is another WSGI client and web framework I have used.</p>

<div class="section" id="creating-the-request-json">
<h2>Creating the Request JSON</h2>
<p>I recommend using <a class="reference external" href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman</a> in most cases, depending on the complexity of the API. If the JSON syntax is straightforward, you can format your data as a python dictionary, then convert it to a JSON object with <tt class="docutils literal">json.dumps</tt> from the standard library's <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.dumps">json module</a>. But JSON can be tricky sometimes. You may also need to pass a dictionary of HTTP headers.</p>
<p>Some APIs have &quot;Postman Collections&quot;, a set of Python (or any language) script templates for the API. In those cases, it might make sense to use those resources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Path One: Make HTTP request with json &amp; requests libraries</strong></p>
<p>Format Python dict with <tt class="docutils literal">json.dumps</tt> from the standard library's <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.loads">json module</a>.&nbsp; Infer API requirements from documentation. Use requests for HTTP.</p>
<p><strong>Path Two: Make HTTP request with Postman &amp; requests library</strong></p>
<p>Use Postman to generate the JSON payload. Plug headers and payload into requests. Use requests library for HTTP.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Postman has a friendly interface for plugging in all your pieces and tinkering with your request body until it works. Make it easier on yourself and use Postman, especially if there are collections. An alternative is to troubleshoot in Python if you are confident in your grasp of the API. I use both options depending on my familiarity with the API at hand.</p>
<p>Once you have the request working, you may <a class="reference external" href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/sending-api-requests/generate-code-snippets/">export your Postman request to almost any language</a>. For Python, you can sometimes export to the <tt class="docutils literal">requests</tt>,&nbsp; <tt class="docutils literal">http.client</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">urllib</tt> libraries. Hit the &quot;code&quot; button in Postman and then copy your code.</p>
<blockquote>
If you choose not to use Postman, you can use the json library. See the use of <tt class="docutils literal">json.dumps()</tt>to convert a dictionary to a JSON object in Example #2 below</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="formatting-your-request">
<h2>Formatting Your Request</h2>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Paste your Postman headers, payload and url into your existing code.</li>
<li>You may want to use a dict or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2020/04/07/python-101-working-with-strings/">string formatting</a> to pass values to your request parameters or url.</li>
<li>If the API uses a token or other form of authorization that needs to be refreshed intermittently, I usually have a function that returns a token. <tt class="docutils literal">token = fetch_token()</tt> Then put the token in the headers dict.&nbsp; <tt class="docutils literal">{&quot;Authorization&quot;: f&quot;basic <span class="pre">{token}&quot;}</span></tt> Finally pass your headers and payload to your&nbsp; <tt class="docutils literal">requests.get</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">requests.request</tt> function along with the endpoint url.

<p><strong>&quot;Gotchyas&quot; To Avoid</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">Status codes</a> are your friend. They offer a hint at why your request is not working. If you see 200 or 201, that's a good sign. They're usually helpful, but sometimes they can be misleading.</li>
<li>Ensure you are defining the correct content-type. I had an experience where Postman defined two conflicting <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">content-type</span></tt> headers and it <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-code-generators/issues/215">caused my request to fail</a>. The server's error message indicated the problem was in my JSON, so it took me a while to figure out the headers were the problem.</li>
<li>Sometimes it makes a difference if your url has <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://</span></tt> vs. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">https://</span></tt> in it.

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>I remember APIs seemed mysterious and daunting before I had used them. But like all things, they can be conquered with knowledge, understanding and tenacity to keep trying until you figure it out. Good luck!</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>GUI stands for &quot;Graphical User Interface&quot;, aka the part of a program designed for human interaction. Adding a GUI to a Python script allows anyone to run it without having to code or use the command line.</p>
<p>There are several GUI libraries in Python. A few I have heard of are Tkinter (comes in the standard library), wxPython, PyQT, easygui, <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui">DearPyGui</a> and PySimpleGUI. I <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/02/29/tkinter-and-python-libraries/">explored Tkinter</a> back when I first got into Python. It was more intricate and offered more control over the look of your app, and took longer to pick up. Gooey is more of a pre-packaged GUI library.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey">Gooey Github page</a> was most useful to me and helped me to do what I needed. The script posted <a class="reference external" href="http://pbpython.com/pandas-gui.html">in this blog</a> helped as well. I needed to enable a human to supply three files and enter a number. Gooey was a good match for this. The library has two branches:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>some basic widgets piggyback off the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2015/10/08/a-intro-to-argparse/">argparse</a> library</li>
<li>another part of the library uses a function called the GooeyParser. The GooeyParser offers more advanced widgets, like a file chooser. This was exactly what I was looking to use to pull in files for my script.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Installing Gooey</strong></p>
<p>Argparse comes stock with Python. You can install Gooey via the <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/01/20/how-to-python-pip-install-new-libraries/">pip installer</a>. Open command prompt or terminal and enter:</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">python <span class="pre">-m</span> pip install Gooey</tt></p>
<p>Below is a basic argparse/Gooey combination script. The argparse version offers a handful of widgets such as checkboxes and dropdown, but I had trouble getting them to work with the GooeyParser (used in 2nd script).</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from argparse import ArgumentParser
from gooey import Gooey

&#64;Gooey(program_name='Email Campaign Reporting Generator', default_size=(575, 600))
def get_args():
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Demonstrating python's vars built-in to store arguments in a python dict.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    parser = ArgumentParser(description='A simple argument parser', epilog='This is where you might put example usage')
    parser.add_argument('Name', action='store', required=True, help='Help text for option X')
    parser.add_argument('Email', help='Help text for option Y', default=False)
    parser.add_argument('Campaign Number', help='Help text for option Z', type=int)
    parser.add_argument('Campaign Segment', choices=['A', 'B','All'], default='a', nargs='?')
    user_inputs = vars(parser.parse_args())
    print(user_inputs)
    name = user_inputs['Name']
    campaign_number = user_inputs['Campaign Number']
    return parser.parse_args()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    get_args()
</pre>

<blockquote>
Side note: Check out Python's <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#vars">vars() built-in</a> function above. It returns the input data as a dictionary called user_inputs. Then we can get the values via the dictionary's keys. Pretty nifty!</blockquote>
<p>The &#64;Gooey() part of the code is an advanced function known as a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/">decorator in Python</a>. Put simply, decorators are functions that modify the function to which they are attached.</p>
<p>Below is my script that uses the more advanced GooeyParser for its &quot;FileChooser&quot; widget. Gooey allows you to group widgets together and set how many widgets per line with the gooey_options={} parameter.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
from gooey import Gooey, GooeyParser

&#64;Gooey(program_name='Email Campaign Reporting Generator', default_size=(575, 600))
def get_args():
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Adding two argument groups, each accepting two arguments.
    Using gooey_options to set layout.
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    parser = GooeyParser(description='Export campaign report spreadsheets and upload below.')
    top_group = parser.add_argument_group(gooey_options={'show_border': False,'columns': 1})
    top_group.add_argument('Contact List', help='Upload Send List (.xlsx)', widget='FileChooser')
    top_group.add_argument('Opens List', help='Upload Opens List (.xlsx)', widget='FileChooser')
    top_group.add_argument('Unsubscribe List', help='Upload Unsubscribe List (.xlsx)', widget='FileChooser')
    bottom_group = parser.add_argument_group(gooey_options={'show_border': False,'columns': 1, 'required':False})
    bottom_group.add_argument('Campaign ID', action='store', help=&quot;Number found in the Campaign 'Reports' tab&quot;)
    bottom_group.add_argument('Campaign Segment', action='store', help='Enter A, B, or All. All lists supplied must match segment.')
    user_inputs = vars(parser.parse_args())
    name = user_inputs['Name']
    return parser.parse_args()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    get_args()
</pre>
<p>Overall, Gooey knows what it wants to be, an easy to use GUI framework for Python. It does it well. Here's a screenshot of my program's shiny GUI:</p>
<img alt="gooey_gui_shot_2" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1431" src="https://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/gooey_gui_shot_2.png" style="width: 578px; height: 603px;" />
<p>Now that I have a GUI on top of my program and it delivers the expected output file, I'm hoping to take it one step further by packaging it up as a Windows .exe file. This would allow it to run as a desktop app on any Windows computer without the need to install Python or library dependencies. I've only begun exploring options to do this but a few libraries I've heard of are pyinstaller, cx_Freeze and Py2Exe. Updates coming if I figure it out. Cheers :D</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I did figure out how to compile my Gooey app to a Windows application with Pyinstaller. You can&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/11/20/packaging-python-as-a-windows-app/">read more on how I did it here</a>.</p>
