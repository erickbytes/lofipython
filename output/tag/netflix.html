                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Being a developer has similarities to the life of a family surviving in
space. Sure, the stakes are lower when writing code versus being chased
by alien life forms, but the core idea is the same. One is faced with a
problem and it must be solved, with varying degrees of consequences for
failure.</p>
<p>I enjoyed watching the Robinsons solve problem after problem to stay
alive in alien worlds and the vacuum of space. I believe you can learn
from anything. <strong>So in that spirit, here are some lessons from the show
for us problem solving humans:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><img alt="tayrob" class="size-full wp-image-2271 alignright" src="https://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/tayrob.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 168px;" />Don't panic when you're in trouble. A cool head is vitally
important to your survival chances when you're in a bind. Judy
demonstrates this quality in evading the raptor-like creatures
chasing her.</li>
<li>Problems solved often lead to more problems to solve. We would be
wise to anticipate what might happen if we do succeed.</li>
<li>Be cautious when venturing into unfamiliar territories. You never
know what could be there to trip you up. Which leads me to my next
point...</li>
<li>Respect nature's ability to f*ck you up. The environment you're in,
other organisms, and bacteria can wreak havoc. Despite our perceived
self-importance, nature is our god. We are but specks in its
creation. Cases in point: the metal-dissolving virus that destroys
Judy's chariot and the poisonous algae Don accidentally discovers
that immobilizes him.</li>
<li>Know when to go for broke, or when to re-group and wait to make your
next move. The Robinsons spent 7 months stocking up at their new
beach home. Until they suffered a setback...<img alt="beach" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2279" src="https://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/beach.jpg" style="width: 2155px; height: 1181px;" /></li>
<li>Adapt your plan when new information becomes available or unexpected
events happen. They will happen.</li>
<li>Think of unconventional ways to use the resources you do have to fix
the problem at hand. Who would have thought a spaceship could be
retrofitted into a boat?</li>
<li>Things often work 83% of the way you expect them to work. Sometimes
that's enough to move on. Or maybe it buys you enough time to figure
out your next move. The electrical field stalled the fleet of robots
long enough for the Robinsons to realize the children should &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies">Lord
of the Flies</a>&quot;
their way to Alpha Centauri.</li>
<li>Question your own motivations, and be open to changing course if you
are wrong. Adler realized he should help Will save Scarecrow's life
after first trying to stop him. Scarecrow then exhibits this same
quality when he turns against his robot comrades to save the
children.</li>
<li>Ethics and morals may conflict with each other. Was Maureen Robinson
wrong for fraudulently saving her son Will? Ethically, yes. But
morally, as a mother saving her son? No.</li>
<li>Make time for your family and friends. Maureen was so busy saving the
family that she didn't read Penny's book. Stop and smell the roses
every once in a while. Or read your daughter's damn book.</li>
<li>Humans are capable of both great compassion and horrible cruelty.
We're running from alien robots, but sometimes we're the monsters?
Cough cough Smith and Hastings... cough. Excuse me. (smh ðŸ¤¦)</li>
<li><img alt="robot" class="wp-image-2282 alignright" src="https://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/robot-1.jpeg" style="width: 358px; height: 179px;" />I'll spare you any parallels about modern artificial
intelligence. The best, most grounded definition I've heard of modern
AI is &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1214392496375025664?lang=en">automated cognition</a>&quot;.</li>
<li>Self-sacrifice is an honorable death to save the lives of others, but
can be frustrating to watch on TV. &quot;Did you really have to kill
yourself there?&quot; - me, several times during the show ðŸ˜†</li>
</ol>
