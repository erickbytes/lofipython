                </h2>

                
                

                <p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer. Below are some thoughts that may help you decide.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>What are your programming goals? Get a coding job? Create an app or website? Become more productive at your current job?</li>
<li>What is your current experience level? Are you starting fresh or do you already know a language or two?</li>
<li>Do you have money saved up? Otherwise, you might need to take out a loan.</li>
</ol>
<p>A computer science degree is typically most expensive. Coding bootcamps are a lower cost option that pack a wide curriculum
into a few weeks or months, but they can still be pricey. The cheapest option is to take a piecemeal approach through various online courses.</p>
<p><strong>School Advantages</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Wholistic approach. You get the ins and outs of programming from a proven curriculum.</li>
<li>Community. You learn with other students and from experienced teachers.</li>
<li>Job placement. Often various schools and bootcamps will connect you to a company.</li>
<li>Credentials. You gain confidence and the backing of your skills by an established institution.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Downsides</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Tuition Money. A lot of what you need to know is available for free or cheap on the web.</li>
<li>Skill level match. Some bootcamps are oriented for beginners, others are more advanced. If you do a bootcamp, make sure it fits your skill level.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you want a coding job</strong>, school makes sense. The bootcamps look to be effective if you can handle the up-front investment.
It's possible to land a job without schooling but much tougher. I am currently considering <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com/">Full Stack Academy</a>.
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.codingdojo.com/">Coding Dojo</a>. There are many out there. CodeAcademy is a popular route as well.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to make an app or website</strong>, the school or the non-school route may both work. For the non-school route, the following languages are good places to start: <em>(note - not a comprehensive list, these are my picks.)</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Web App or Website: HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript</li>
<li>Web App or Website Framework: Flask, Django, py4web, Ruby on Rails, React</li>
<li>iOS app: Swift plus Apple's Xcode environment, Beeware (python library)</li>
<li>Android App: Java or Kotlin, Beeware</li>
<li>General Coding: Python or Ruby</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you want to be more productive at work</strong>, I recommend learning Python. More on Python and where
to start <a class="reference external" href="https://lofipython.com/marketer-slash-programmer/">here</a>. <a class="reference external" href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate the Boring Stuff With Python</a>
is a great resource for boosting your productivity also.</p>
<p>It's not easy to decide whether or not school is for you. I'm still unsure after a year and a half of programming on the side. No matter what, continue to learn multiple languages and strive for a better grasp of the ones you know. Good luck!</p>
<p><strong>My decision: continue self-study and learning online for free.</strong></p>
<p>As of 8 months after writing this post, I have concluded that learning for free online was the right choice for me. I've achieved many of my programming goals in the last three years,
thanks to materials available from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python">Codeacademy</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python">Coursera</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3d-n41Tobw">YouTube</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1720421/how-to-concatenate-two-lists-in-python?rq=1">Stack Overflow</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">countless helpful resources,</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://pymotw.com/3/glob/index.html">interesting blogs</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html">documentation</a>.
I've talked with others who need the in-person assistance that a bootcamp offers to learn. Do what works for you. Good luck with your decision.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Several years later, I also get paid to use Python and Excel for a living! I studied for free online intermittently over 2 years to achieve it.</p>

                <p>We move in cycles. Work, rest, re-energize, play, repeat. The rhythm of
life.</p>
<p>I began my coding endeavors in the fall of 2015. After 6 months of
steady <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/03/11/random-findings/">coding practice and studying</a>, I
went from no knowledge to a basic hobbyist programmer capable of
creating a website with the help of <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/03/03/starting-to-almost-kinda-think-about-creating-a-web-app/">a framework</a>.
I published a few of my own primitive apps. Then I relapsed. Coding and
my full-time job wore me out. I stayed away from coding for about 6
months.</p>
<p>My ultimate goal to learn to code was to be able to build my own
websites and apps. I've done that now. I've found ways to do it more
efficiently, which I will share in future posts.</p>
<p>Two of my recent moonshot projects were Social Queues, a social playlist
builder for Spotify and Dropcycle, a bicycle on demand pick-up service.
Neither went anywhere, or really were that good of ideas, but I was able
to get to bare minimum viable product status, with little to no code.
Sites like <a class="reference external" href="http://carrd.co">carrd.co</a> work well to build a quick
landing page as proof of concept or landing page test. My favorite
project might be my <a class="reference external" href="http://tameimpala.pythonanywhere.com/tameimpala">Tame Impala website</a>,
which I used <a class="reference external" href="https://lofipython.com/getting-started-with-web2py/">web2py</a>
to build the site and <a class="reference external" href="http://pythonanywhere.com">pythonanywhere</a> to host for free.</p>
<p>My aspirations have shifted. Instead of just building apps, I want to
build apps that are useful to others and help me achieve financial
freedom and the ability to own my time.</p>
<p>I believe in cycles of learning. Similar to being in school: semester of
study, then time off to rest, then semester of study, more rest, etc.
The time away is as important as the time of study. Earlier this year, I
returned to programming and web development. After a long time of not
writing on this blog, I'm back at it. New cycle.</p>

                <h2 class="title">
                    <a href="https://lofipython.com/starting-to-almost-kinda-think-about-creating-a-web-app.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to &quot;Starting to Almost Kinda Think About Creating a Web App&quot;">Starting to Almost Kinda Think About Creating a Web App</a>
                </h2>

                
                

                <p>One of my first goals when I started learning Python was to build a web application. Once you've gotten a basic grip on Python, you might be ready to learn about web frameworks. A web framework consists of software designed to aid in web development. They make it easier to create a website or web app - if you know how to use them. Unfortunately, there is a learning curve to using the frameworks but thankfully there is plenty o' documentation to go around to help you.</p>
<p>Here are the two <a class="reference external" href="https://www.airpair.com/python/posts/django-flask-pyramid">Python Frameworks</a> I've chosen to investigate:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Django - widely used, great community support, comes with just about everything built in. Can be used for smaller apps or multi-page/app websites.</li>
<li>Flask - a &quot;microframework&quot; used for smaller apps. Possibly more manageable for someone beginning a smaller project (me!)</li>
</ul>
<p>So as a beginnerish-level coder, I've chosen to start with Flask; I also found <a class="reference external" href="http://opentechschool.github.io/python-flask/">this sweet guide</a> that I think will help. Maybe someday I will graduate to Django, it sounds like a great framework. I've also decided that first I need to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design">brush up on my HTML</a> - And according to a lot of what I've read it doesn't hurt to know CSS/Javascript. So this whole &quot;build a web app&quot; idea will continue, albeit with some hurdles to clear first.</p>
<p>Edit: I ended up choosing web2py, which I hadn't even considered when I wrote this originally! Here's a <a class="reference external" href="https://lofipython.com/choosing-a-web-development-path/">post about why I chose it</a>.</p>
