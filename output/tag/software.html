                <p>Occasionally you will find a video or talk that connects or resonates with you in a great way. Rich Hickey's <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc">&quot;Hammock Driven Development&quot;</a>, a self-described &quot;rant&quot; is packed with wisdom. I keep coming back to re-watch and today, I have written down some key points from this amazing rant!</p>
<div class="section" id="key-ideas">
<h2>Key Ideas</h2>
<p><strong>Take more time to think through your problem.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>When was the last time you...</p>
<p>thought about some for a whole day?</p>
<p>thought about something for a whole month or year?</p>
<p>Hammock Driven Development, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>On Bugs</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Bugs are cheaper to fix in development.</li>
<li>Least expensive to avoid in design</li>
<li>Most expensive in to fix in production</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analysis &amp; Design, Simplified</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Identify problem trying to solve.</li>
<li>Assess whether it solves that problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On Problem Solving</strong></p>
<div class="wp-image-7029 figure">
<img alt="" src="https://pythonmarketer.files.wordpress.com/2022/06/solve-problems-1.png?w=730" />
</div>
<p><strong>Problem Solving (cont.)</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>State the problem out loud.</li>
<li>Understand the problem's facts, context and constraints.</li>
<li>What don't you know?</li>
<li>Find problems in your solution.</li>
<li>Write it all down.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More Input, Better Output</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Read in and around your space.</li>
<li>Look critically at other solutions.</li>
<li>You can't connect things you don't know about.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On Focus</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>On the hammock, no one knows if you're sleeping and they don't bother you because of this.</li>
<li>Computers are distracting.</li>
<li>Let loved ones know you are going to be &quot;gone&quot;, focusing deeply for some time.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Waking Mind vs Background Mind</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The waking mind is good at critical thinking.</li>
<li>Use waking time to assign tasks to background mind.</li>
<li>The background mind is good at making connections and good at strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sleep According to Scientific American:</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The brain processes info learned while sleeping.</li>
<li>Sleep makes memories stonger and weeds out irrelevant details.</li>
<li>Our brain finds hidden relations among memories to solve waking problems.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Closing Ideas</strong></p>
<p>Write the proposed solution down. Hammock time is important &quot;mind's eye time&quot;. We switch from &quot;input mode&quot; to &quot;recall mode&quot; during hammock time. Wait overnight, or sometimes months, to think about your problem, sleep sober for best results! Eventually coding is required, and your feedback loop is important, but &quot;don't lean on it too much&quot;. You will be wrong, facts and requirements will change. Mistakes happen. That's fine, do not be afraid of being wrong. /rant</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>The basis of many great programs revolve around a simple set of operations:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Open a file.</li>
<li>Do something with the file contents.</li>
<li>Save the new file for the user.</li>
</ol>
<p>Python is nice and simple for this.&nbsp;Paste the below lines into a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=text+editor&amp;oq=text+edit&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.2054j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">text editor</a> and save as a .py file. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb/wiki/Python-&amp;-pip-Windows-installation">You need to have Python 3 installed</a>. In the same folder as your .py file, save a .txt file with some words in it. Alright, let's write some code:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
file_name = input(&quot;Enter your file name. e.g. words.txt&quot;)
file_handle = open(file_name, &quot;r&quot;)
lines = file_handle.readlines()
print (lines)
file_handle.close()
</pre>
<p>In line 1, we ask the user to enter their file name with Python's raw_input function. When the program runs, the user enters their text file name with extension. This line stores the name in a variable called file_name.</p>
<p><strong>In line 2,</strong> we open your text file and store it in a variable I have named file_handle. Think of the file handle as a bridge between your code and the text file. Quick point about the 'r' above: that tells the program to open the file in &quot;Read&quot; mode. There are several different file modes in programming. Some modes are just for reading an existing file, some are just for writing a new file, and some are capable of both. <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16208206/confused-by-python-file-mode-w/16208298">This Stack Overflow post</a> is well written and details the differences between file modes. Once established, the file handle allows you to read the file's contents or write new contents to the file.</p>
<p><strong>In line 3,</strong>&nbsp;we are calling the .readlines() method on our file handle. This method takes the file contents and stores them, line by line, into a list named &quot;lines&quot;. An alternative method is .read(), which opens the file and stores its contents as one string. Try switching this out in place of&nbsp; .readlines() to check out the difference.</p>
<p><strong>In line 4,</strong> we are printing the stored lines to show them to the user. We now have the file contents, ready to be used however we please.</p>
<p><strong>In line 5</strong>, we are closing the file.</p>
<p>Below, we are going to write a new file. Let's pretend we've done something worth saving with our lines and now want to save them to a new file. We will represent this as the variable &quot;output&quot; in the first line below.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
file_name = input(&quot;Enter any file name.&quot;)
save_file = open(file_name, &quot;w&quot;)
save_file.write(&quot;Here is some text to save in a file.&quot;)
save_file.close()
</pre>
<p>In line 1, we are using Python's input function to ask the user what to name the file and storing it in a variable named file_name.</p>
<p>In line 2,&nbsp; we are calling the open function again that we used in the first example, but this time, notice the &quot;w&quot;. This indicates that we are opening the file in &quot;write&quot; mode.</p>
<p>In line 3, we are calling the .write() method on our file handle, named save_file, and passing it our text to be saved in our new file.</p>
<p><strong>In line 4</strong>, we are closing the file, completing the creation of our new file in the same folder as our .py program file.</p>
<p>Your program is now ready to be run. Double-click your .py file to execute it.</p>
<p>Before learning Python, file operations were a mystery to me. It took me a while to understand this clearly, and I wanted to share. Once you master these basic file operations, programming gets to be a lot more fun. Do try it out for yourself :D</p>

                <p>I'm finally coming around in my understanding of Javascript. Here are a few quick explanations to help you if you are new to it.</p>
<p><strong>Javascript</strong> = The language of the web. Most commonly used as a complement to HTML and CSS to create an interactive website.</p>
<p><strong>JQuery</strong> = A popular Javascript library with many powerful commands that are quick and easy to call.</p>
<p><strong>Node.JS</strong> = Software that allows you to run Javascript from the command line without being connected to the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Express.JS</strong> = A popular Node.JS framework.</p>
<p><strong>Angular</strong> = A popular front-end Javascript web framework. There are many out there but this seems to be the one I've heard of the most.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><strong>I've begun to see a pattern with programming languages:</strong></div>
<div class="line">1) Learn to execute the core building blocks. (using variables, loops, functions, etc.)</div>
<div class="line">2) Learn more advanced libraries, documentation and uses.</div>
<div class="line">3) Consider using and learning web frameworks depending on what you're trying to do with the language.</div>
<div class="line">4) Practice to hone your knowledge. Build things you like.</div>
</div>
<p>I've also noticed that Javascript has been easier to learn than Python was for me, because it's not my first programming language. The concepts are the same. The syntax can trip me up at times, but I'm currently flying through <a class="reference external" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript">Codeacademy's Javascript courses</a>. Sometimes it even seems fun!</p>

                    <a href="https://pythonmarketer.com/should-i-go-to-programming-school.html" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to &quot;Should You Go To Programming School?&quot;">Should You Go To Programming School?</a>
                </h2>

                
                

                <p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer. Below are some thoughts that may help you decide.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>What are your programming goals? Get a coding job? Create an app or website? Become more productive at your current job?</li>
<li>What is your current experience level? Are you starting fresh or do you already know a language or two?</li>
<li>Do you have money saved up? Otherwise, you might need to take out a loan.</li>
</ol>
<p>A computer science degree is typically most expensive. Coding bootcamps are a lower cost option that pack a wide curriculum into a few weeks or months, but they can still be pricey. The cheapest option is to take a piecemeal approach through various online courses.</p>
<p><strong>School Advantages</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Wholistic approach. You get the ins and outs of programming from a proven curriculum.</li>
<li>Community. You learn with other students and from experienced teachers.</li>
<li>Job placement. Often various schools and bootcamps will connect you to a company.</li>
<li>Credentials. You gain confidence and the backing of your skills by an established institution.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Downsides</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Tuition Money. A lot of&nbsp;what you need to know is available for free or cheap on the web.</li>
<li>Skill level match. Some bootcamps are oriented for beginners, others are more advanced. If you do a bootcamp, make sure it fits your skill level.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you want a coding job</strong>, school makes sense. The bootcamps look to be effective if you can handle the up-front investment. It's possible to land a job without schooling but much tougher. I am currently considering <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com/">Full Stack Academy</a>. and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.codingdojo.com/">Coding Dojo</a>. There are many out there. CodeAcademy is a popular route as well.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to make an app or website</strong>, the school or the non-school route may both work. For the non-school route, the following languages are good places to start: <em>(note - not a comprehensive list, these are my picks.)</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Web App or Website: HTML, CSS,&nbsp;Python, Javascript</li>
<li>Web App or Website Framework:&nbsp; Flask, Django, py4web, Ruby on Rails, React</li>
<li>iOS app: Swift plus Apple's Xcode environment, Beeware (python library)</li>
<li>Android App: Java or Kotlin, Beeware</li>
<li>General Coding: Python or Ruby</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you want to be more productive at work</strong>, I recommend learning Python. More on Python and where to start <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/02/22/marketer-slash-programmer/">here</a>.&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate the Boring Stuff With Python</a> is a great resource for boosting your productivity also.</p>
<p>It's not easy to decide whether or not school is for you. I'm still unsure after a year and a half of programming on the side. No matter what, continue to learn multiple languages and strive for a better grasp of the ones you know. Good luck!</p>
<p><strong>My decision: continue self-study and learning online for free.</strong></p>
<p>As of 8 months after writing this post, I have concluded that learning for free online was the right choice for me. I've achieved many of my programming goals in the last three years, thanks to materials available from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python">Codeacademy</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python">Coursera</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3d-n41Tobw">YouTube</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1720421/how-to-concatenate-two-lists-in-python?rq=1">Stack Overflow</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">countless helpful resources,</a><a class="reference external" href="https://pymotw.com/3/glob/index.html">interesting blogs</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html">documentation</a>. I've talked with others who need the in-person assistance that a bootcamp offers to learn. Do what works for you. Good luck with your decision.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Several years later, I also get paid to use Python and Excel for a living! I studied for free online intermittently over 2 years to achieve it.</p>
