                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Yesterday, I experienced a flow state where I became manically obsessed
with perfecting a script I was working on. I think it's beautiful code,
about 100 lines long without <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/">docstrings</a>. It solves a real need
and it felt great to write it. Some scripts feel terrible to write and
you know they're bad. However, this one felt like one of the best I've
ever written.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Flow</a> seems like a
mythical, unattainable state these days as portrayed in media, but we
can all agree... we love it. When you're in flow, you know it and you
feel a grace in improving your work. For coders, maybe it's by wrapping
up a few lines here and there into functions. <a class="reference external" href="https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html">Refactoring</a>, reordering,
handling loose ends or edge cases, writing docstrings with supporting
documentation and clarifying that you really understand what's
happening... these things are all mundane at times but critical to
writing reliable code.</p>
<p>While doing these typical tasks, you're attaining skill and mastery, one
of the highest dopamine hits humans can register legally in all 50
states. You know how much better this iteration of code is than when you
first learned to write software. You take bits and pieces from past
projects and fit them all together into a cohesive, purposeful program.
For example, I was tickled to use Python's <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files">readlines() file reading
function</a>
to get the last line of a text file. I learned about this function in my
first ever free <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python">Python course on Coursera</a>, 7 years ago. Thanks again
Dr. Chuck!</p>
<p>This time, I realized my flow when researching <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 time format
strings</a> and guiding them
into an HTTP request with the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">requests library</a>. A new solution
emerged, regurgitated from a prior project and mashed up into a more
refined form to satisfy the project's requirements. I combined old and
new ideas into a better solution than I had ever thought, a fitting
complement for the <a class="reference external" href="https://lofipython.com/how-to-make-json-requests-with-python/">API</a> at
hand. Time will tell if the solution will actually work as well as I
hope.</p>
<p>Flow is real. You can find work that puts you in a flow state, and it
doesn't have to be super interesting work to get there. The learning
process pays rewards in competency when exposure to different domains
combine. Einstein knew a form of this as <a class="reference external" href="https://evernote.com/blog/einsteins-unique-approach-to-thinking/#:~:text=He%20viewed%20taking%20music%20breaks,come%20up%20with%20new%20ideas.">combinatory play</a>.
Repetition enhances this effect and solidifies your foundation. Flow
makes it fun! Only rarely do I feel the highest level of engrossment in
my work. I sensed I was flowing on this recent project. You can find
these types of challenges too. Keep searching for your flow!</p>

                <p><a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/">Pandas</a> is amazing, what else is there to say? Learning the nuances of its API have yielded tons of times where it helped me get stuff done.</p>
<p>I recently picked up the <a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.assign.html">pandas dataframe's &quot;assign&quot; function</a> for creating a new column of values. This is an elegant way to set a column of values in tabular data with the pandas library. Below you'll see two ways to set a column of values in pandas. In the first way, I am chaining two assign functions together to create 2 new columns, &quot;sound&quot; and &quot;type&quot;. I prefer using assign because it looks better and it does not result in any warnings from pandas. Highly recommend getting familiar with pandas functions like assign and API nuances like <a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/series.html?highlight=str%20accessors#accessors">Series accessors</a> to up your tabular data game.</p>

                <p>Every Python programmer has undoubtedly come across some crazy characters. The <a class="reference external" href="https://ftfy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">ftfy library &quot;Fixes Text For You&quot;</a> and acts like a swiss army knife when you've got questionable characters breaking your script. In my case, an HTTP request was failing because of weird cryptic letters hiding in the data when it was only supposed to be an apostrophe. This library fixed my text and made it appear flawless. I really like ftfy because it solves a common problem, fixing &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake#:~:text=Mojibake%20(%E6%96%87%E5%AD%97%E5%8C%96%E3%81%91%3B%20IPA%3A,from%20a%20different%20writing%20system.">mojibake</a>&quot; or mangled characters.

                <p>Did your script run to completion? Sure, you might log some tracebacks along the way or terminate the program early with <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit">sys.exit()</a>. But did your script actually run completely to the end? I have yet to use the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html">Trace module</a> but it seems worth checking out also. Visualization tools like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/alexmojaki/heartrate">heartrate</a> are worth mentioning too depending on how you are running your scripts. Task runners typically have run status tracking as well. I like having a visual confirmation by logging some sort of information when a script finishes as intended. It's nice to know when your scripts finished or not. Use logging and Trace to up your reliability of your scripts.</p>

The replace is done via a pandas <a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/series.html#api-series-str">str accessor</a>. In the pat string, the parentheses are escaped with slashes and separated by pipes &quot;|&quot;. They act as an <a class="reference external" href="https://realpython.com/python-or-operator/">or operator</a>, succinctly chaining multiple characters together for matching and in this case replacing them with nothing. Pretty nifty. If you read the <a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/">pandas docs</a>, you'll find regex is accessible in different parts of the API. Dive in, it's some of my favorite documentation to snoop. There is so much you can do with pandas. This example demonstrates how its flexible functions get the job done efficiently.</p>

                <p>If you write Python code, there's probably been a time or two when you saw the dreaded <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#MemoryError">&quot;MemoryError&quot;</a>.
This happens after one of your Python scripts stops because your computer has no spare <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a> to execute it.
I recently experienced this frustration whilst trying to write hundreds of thousands of csv files. However, this time I grasped for tools that support smarter memory management.
Now, I can watch my computer's memory bounce around with the Windows Resource Monitor. Python has quite a few memory profiling libraries for monitoring memory too!</p>

<p><strong>Memory Tips and Guides</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Use only the data you need. Any data you read in and aren't using is held in memory. The <a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html">usecols argument</a> in pandas is a great way to read a csv and only use the columns you need.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://pythonspeed.com/articles/chunking-pandas/">Reading data in chunks</a> with the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/v1.3.5/pandas/io/parsers/readers.py#L491-L586">chunksize argument</a> is another way to reduce memory usage for large datasets.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://pythonspeed.com/articles/pandas-dataframe-series-memory-usage/">Measuring the memory usage of a Pandas dataframe</a></li>
<li>Some tools are line oriented, others are function oriented. If your code contains large functions, you might favor a line based profiling tool.</li>
<li>Be aware of the overhead some memory tools may incur. memory_profile was clocked with a whopping 270x slowdown per the Scalene PyCon talk below. The talk shows an awesome comparison of these Python profiling libraries:</li>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>When you'll see &quot;MemoryError&quot; depends on your computer's hardware, the size of your dataset and what operations you need to script out. Generally speaking, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output">I/O</a> or file reads and writes are more expensive operations.</p>
<p>The tools in this post will help you anticipate how much computing power you have available, monitor your memory consumption more closely and avoid pushing your computer past its limits.
You can do things like reading data in chunks and only using the columns you need to reduce your memory consumption.
Realizing these tools and strategies can make getting things done with Python a smoother ride.</p>

                <p>When assessing your environment, problem or your goal, meticulously scout the tools at your disposal. When you're learning a new job, a new project or a programming language's tools for example, it pays to have a grasp of your options. Researching what documentation, guides, tools or libraries are at your disposal will help you accomplish your goal. That sounds obvious but here's what I mean.</p>
<p>Seek out resources. Bookmark links and support info in an Excel spreadsheet with a handful of columns, for example.
Soon, you'll amass a collection tools and guides to get things done. Most companies or products have &quot;resource centers&quot;,
mountains of internal documentation, tools and blogs. At many organizations, people have likely made tools for something
they needed in the past then moved on. Often these tools can be leveraged for anyone who cares enough to seek out,
read about and learn how to use them. Dig for these tools too. Find resources by googling products you use.
Subscribe to their <a class="reference external" href="https://status.box.com/">status pages</a>. Look for other tools that may help you in a pinch
like <a class="reference external" href="https://support.goto.com/webinar/system-check-attendee">GoToWebinar's system check</a> to help someone figure out what's wrong
with their browser. I love these types of browser-based troubleshooting software. These are ways to gain a better understanding of technologies
that might affect or improve your productivity or day to day goals.</p>
<p>I think of &quot;resource scoping&quot; as crawling these types of resources for every tool, guide and support contact that might good to know. The effort you put in to scope available resources is worth the time spent. Check out the &quot;resource scoping&quot;
I did in <a class="reference external" href="https://lofipython.com/python-libraries-tools-resources-for-creative-and-academic-writers/">this post I wrote focused on tools for writers</a>!</p>

                <p>This morning I'm meditating on my usual apps or websites I visit through the course of a typical day. I wonder how limited or expansive it could be in the span of all that's waiting to be consumed on the internet. I like reading online or physical books too and writing. Consider your own circle of the internet. What sites do you frequent? What do you consume? This is more rhetorical. It's good to pose the question and consider what you might be missing. I recently downloaded a bunch of nature and hiking apps. Maybe that means I want more of that in my life. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgw_yprN_-w&amp;ab_channel=LiliDVLima">Happy trails</a>.</p>

                <p>In September 2021, I tested out the recommended ads runner, <a class="reference external" href="https://wordads.co/">WordAds</a>, on this WordPress blog. 6,182 ads were served over the course of a month, earning $0.86 from impressions and clicks. My average CPM or cost per thousand impressions was $0.14. My blog averages about 1,600 views a month at the moment, mostly fueled by various search engines. Here's an example of one ad that ran:</p>

<p class="caption"><strong>Example Ad Run on This Site Shown Above</strong></p>
</div>
<p>In my WordPress account, I upgraded to the business plan. This gave me access to WordPress plug-ins. I enabled the <a class="reference external" href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/">Yoast SEO plug-in</a> and activated its site optimization. I also enabled the maximum ads possible in my settings. In spite of these efforts, the results were sparse. Maybe there's more that I could have done. But this blog is passive and more like a hobby at the moment. I'm ok with a blog that makes $0.86 per month. Maybe someday it will be worth more. But I enjoy writing so it's all good. My skills grow and maybe I share something with someone across the world. That's what keeps me coming back.</p>
<p>I concluded I will not be running ads anytime soon. I wanted to get a baseline of what I was leaving on the table by not running ads. Now I can project when I might tap into the blog's potential traffic revenue, if ever. It seems I would need much higher views per month before ads makes sense with my level of traffic, 65 blog followers and minor social media clout.</p>
<p>There's also the added benefit of not serving up people's data to ad companies. Ads seem to be a generally accepted way to earn from your internet labors. But right now, they're not for this blog. Good luck monetizing your blog. Or just writing for the hell of it!</p>

                <p>Black is a code formatting tool that I have been testing out recently to see what the hype is about. It is the defacto &quot;uncompromising code formatter in Python&quot;. I normally do not use any code formatters since I'm not required to use them. This short post aims to convince you that Black is an insightful way to see the parts of your code that are dangerously unreadable.</p>
<p>I have found it interesting to see what black does with my gnarliest code. It has taught me what is considered &quot;good formatting&quot; by some Pythonistas. The areas where I see the most improvement is how it enforces <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP-8</a>'s characters per line limit. Often before, I didn't know how to break my code into several lines. My scripts tended to have one-liners trailing off the edge of my text editor. Black teaches you new ways to organize your code and makes it easier to understand. Now I write my code like Black the first time instead of letting it trail off the screen.</p>
<p>Initially I was hesitant to try Black because I didn't want to sabotage my own code style. But since running Black on a few of my scripts, it has taught me new ways to write code. Give Black a chance and you will learn how to write more readable Python.</p>
