                <p>Below are two practical Python libraries for text processing. This function uses <a class="reference external" href="https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/api_reference.html?highlight=correct#textblob.blob.TextBlob.correct">textblob's spelling correction</a> along with <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org/project/language-tool-python/">language_tool_python</a>, which applies grammatical corrections via the <a class="reference external" href="https://languagetool.org/http-api/swagger-ui/#!/default/post_check">Language Tool API</a>. I added these text processing transformations into my <a class="reference external" href="https://positivethoughts.pythonanywhere.com/">concept text generation app</a>. These are free, public APIs up to around 20 requests per second. You can send both text and receive back an improved version of your text, ideally altering and improving your writing.</p>
<p>I found 2 errors when I piped the text of this post into the below code: the proper noun &quot;textblob&quot; corrected to &quot;text blow's&quot; and the word &quot;app&quot; corrected to &quot;pp&quot;. Be sure to proof your results. Regardless, I like having these two Python tools in my bag!</p>

It is tailored for a PythonAnywhere environment.

                <p>Who is the world's greatest footballer, Messi or Ronaldo? EA Sports surely has calculated the answer to this question in their player ratings. They rate peak Crisitiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Luka Modrić at 99 overall, with Neymar and Lewandowski at 98. Anecdotally, Messi has won 7 <a class="reference external" href="https://www.topendsports.com/sport/soccer/list-player-of-the-year-ballondor.htm">Ballon d'Or</a>, the highest individual football honor one can achieve each year. Ronaldo has won 5 B'allon d'Or. Modrić has won 1 Ballon d'Or. Lewandowski was runner up this year, but has never won the honor. Neymar has never won a Ballon d'Or.</p>
<p>In <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ea.com/games/fifa/fifa-22">FIFA</a>, a player's video game representation is modeled intricately in a series of traits and specialties characterizing each player. The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.easports.com/fifa/ultimate-team/api/fut/item">&quot;Ultimate Team&quot; EA Sports API</a> is viewable as a plain json page or more cheekily with one line of <a class="reference external" href="https://curl.se/">curl</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jqlang/jq">jq, a &quot;command line json processor&quot;</a>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
curl 'https://www.easports.com/fifa/ultimate-team/api/fut/item' | jq '.'
</pre>
<p>Enter this in a <a class="reference external" href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/shell-tools/">shell</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line">command line</a>. The result is beautiful, readable, pretty printed json!</p>
<div class="section" id="messi-top-vs-ronaldo-bottom-fifa-player-ratings">

<p>These ratings represent the players at their peak of their careers. Messi is a better dribbler, while Ronaldo has more power and strength. Messi has the edge in free kicks, curve in his shot and &quot;longshots&quot; 99 to 98 over Cristiano. They are tied at &quot;finishing&quot;, each with 99. Ronaldo has the &quot;Power Free-Kick&quot; trait, whereas Messi has &quot;Chip Shot&quot;, &quot;Finesse Shot&quot; and &quot;Playmaker&quot; traits giving him an edge.</p>
<p>EA's ratings suggest that both are prominent goal scorers, with a slight edge to Messi in finesse and shooting from distance. However, there's something to be said for kicking the ball really damn hard. Ronaldo has superior raw shot power and a lethal combo of more powerful jump and stronger headers. All this combined with an &quot;Aerial Threat&quot; specialty enables Ronaldo to vault above and around defenders to smash in golazos off the volley. Ronaldo sizes up to 6' 2&quot; (187 cm) vs. Messi's 5' 7&quot; (170 cm) frame. This Portugese man definitely has an advantage in getting higher in the air. But the Argentinian is <a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cc59jtvjk_0/">quite darty</a>.</p>
<p>Messi has incredible accuracy from distance. He's also a better passer all around and has perfect &quot;vision&quot;, great qualities for winning football games. Only in crossing does he have a lower passing rating. Ronaldo is also 10 points better at &quot;penalties&quot; or penalty kicks. The closer he gets to the goal, the more dangerous he is. Messi is more dangerous with the ball while dribbling, passing or shooting except when taking a PK.</p>
<p>Advantages can be gained in many different aspects of soccer. EA has developed a fun dataset to model these all time greats across several football skill dimensions. In <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/fifa/fifa-22/ratings/ratings-database">2022's version of the game</a>, Messi is rated a 93, with Cristiano 91. Clearly these two are worthy of top honors. Don't forget Robert Lewandowski, with a 92 rating, who consistently lights up the Champions League and Bundesliga.</p>
<p><strong>jq ftw</strong></p>
<p>I had never used jq before this. Really enjoyed the quick, stylish and practical view of some json. This cool terminal display and syntax highlighting was on my Chromebook shell. It's neat how easily you can pretty print json with jq. I rate it a 99 for json pretty processing and pretty printing on the FIFA scale. Read more in the <a class="reference external" href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/tutorial/">jq documentation</a>!</p>

                </h2>

                
                

                <p>Yesterday, I experienced a flow state where I became manically obsessed
with perfecting a script I was working on. I think it's beautiful code,
about 100 lines long without <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/">docstrings</a>. It solves a real need
and it felt great to write it. Some scripts feel terrible to write and
you know they're bad. However, this one felt like one of the best I've
ever written.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Flow</a> seems like a
mythical, unattainable state these days as portrayed in media, but we
can all agree... we love it. When you're in flow, you know it and you
feel a grace in improving your work. For coders, maybe it's by wrapping
up a few lines here and there into functions. <a class="reference external" href="https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html">Refactoring</a>, reordering,
handling loose ends or edge cases, writing docstrings with supporting
documentation and clarifying that you really understand what's
happening... these things are all mundane at times but critical to
writing reliable code.</p>
<p>While doing these typical tasks, you're attaining skill and mastery, one
of the highest dopamine hits humans can register legally in all 50
states. You know how much better this iteration of code is than when you
first learned to write software. You take bits and pieces from past
projects and fit them all together into a cohesive, purposeful program.
For example, I was tickled to use Python's <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files">readlines() file reading
function</a>
to get the last line of a text file. I learned about this function in my
first ever free <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python">Python course on Coursera</a>, 7 years ago. Thanks again
Dr. Chuck!</p>
<p>This time, I realized my flow when researching <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 time format
strings</a> and guiding them
into an HTTP request with the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">requests library</a>. A new solution
emerged, regurgitated from a prior project and mashed up into a more
refined form to satisfy the project's requirements. I combined old and
new ideas into a better solution than I had ever thought, a fitting
complement for the <a class="reference external" href="https://lofipython.com/how-to-make-json-requests-with-python/">API</a> at
hand. Time will tell if the solution will actually work as well as I
hope.</p>
<p>Flow is real. You can find work that puts you in a flow state, and it
doesn't have to be super interesting work to get there. The learning
process pays rewards in competency when exposure to different domains
combine. Einstein knew a form of this as <a class="reference external" href="https://evernote.com/blog/einsteins-unique-approach-to-thinking/#:~:text=He%20viewed%20taking%20music%20breaks,come%20up%20with%20new%20ideas.">combinatory play</a>.
Repetition enhances this effect and solidifies your foundation. Flow
makes it fun! Only rarely do I feel the highest level of engrossment in
my work. I sensed I was flowing on this recent project. You can find
these types of challenges too. Keep searching for your flow!</p>

                <p><a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/">Pandas</a> is amazing, what else is there to say? Learning the nuances of its API have yielded tons of times where it helped me get stuff done.</p>
<p>I recently picked up the <a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.assign.html">pandas dataframe's &quot;assign&quot; function</a> for creating a new column of values. This is an elegant way to set a column of values in tabular data with the pandas library. Below you'll see two ways to set a column of values in pandas. In the first way, I am chaining two assign functions together to create 2 new columns, &quot;sound&quot; and &quot;type&quot;. I prefer using assign because it looks better and it does not result in any warnings from pandas. Highly recommend getting familiar with pandas functions like assign and API nuances like <a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/series.html?highlight=str%20accessors#accessors">Series accessors</a> to up your tabular data game.</p>

The <a class="reference external" href="https://ftfy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">ftfy library &quot;Fixes Text For You&quot;</a> and acts like a swiss army knife when you've got questionable characters breaking your script. In my case, an HTTP request was failing because of weird cryptic letters hiding in the data when it was only supposed to be an apostrophe. This library fixed my text and made it appear flawless. I really like ftfy because it solves a common problem, fixing &quot;<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake#:~:text=Mojibake%20(%E6%96%87%E5%AD%97%E5%8C%96%E3%81%91%3B%20IPA%3A,from%20a%20different%20writing%20system.">mojibake</a>&quot; or mangled characters.

                <p>Did your script run to completion? Sure, you might log some tracebacks along the way or terminate the program early with <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.exit">sys.exit()</a>. But did your script actually run completely to the end? I have yet to use the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html">Trace module</a> but it seems worth checking out also. Visualization tools like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/alexmojaki/heartrate">heartrate</a> are worth mentioning too depending on how you are running your scripts. Task runners typically have run status tracking as well. I like having a visual confirmation by logging some sort of information when a script finishes as intended. It's nice to know when your scripts finished or not. Use logging and Trace to up your reliability of your scripts.</p>

<p><strong>Regex is cool.</strong></p>
<p>Grasping the intricacies of what this code is doing feels elegant when you connect the dots.. or pipes. The replace is done via a pandas <a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/series.html#api-series-str">str accessor</a>. In the pat string, the parentheses are escaped with slashes and separated by pipes &quot;|&quot;. They act as an <a class="reference external" href="https://realpython.com/python-or-operator/">or operator</a>, succinctly chaining multiple characters together for matching and in this case replacing them with nothing. Pretty nifty. If you read the <a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/">pandas docs</a>, you'll find regex is accessible in different parts of the API. Dive in, it's some of my favorite documentation to snoop. There is so much you can do with pandas. This example demonstrates how its flexible functions get the job done efficiently.</p>

                <p>If you write Python code, there's probably been a time or two when you saw the dreaded <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#MemoryError">&quot;MemoryError&quot;</a>.
This happens after one of your Python scripts stops because your computer has no spare <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a> to execute it.
I recently experienced this frustration whilst trying to write hundreds of thousands of csv files. However, this time I grasped for tools that support smarter memory management.
Now, I can watch my computer's memory bounce around with the Windows Resource Monitor. Python has quite a few memory profiling libraries for monitoring memory too!</p>

<p><strong>Memory Tips and Guides</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Use only the data you need. Any data you read in and aren't using is held in memory. The <a class="reference external" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html">usecols argument</a> in pandas is a great way to read a csv and only use the columns you need.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://pythonspeed.com/articles/chunking-pandas/">Reading data in chunks</a> with the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/v1.3.5/pandas/io/parsers/readers.py#L491-L586">chunksize argument</a> is another way to reduce memory usage for large datasets.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://pythonspeed.com/articles/pandas-dataframe-series-memory-usage/">Measuring the memory usage of a Pandas dataframe</a></li>
<li>Some tools are line oriented, others are function oriented. If your code contains large functions, you might favor a line based profiling tool.</li>
<li>Be aware of the overhead some memory tools may incur. memory_profile was clocked with a whopping 270x slowdown per the Scalene PyCon talk below. The talk shows an awesome comparison of these Python profiling libraries:</li>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>When you'll see &quot;MemoryError&quot; depends on your computer's hardware, the size of your dataset and what operations you need to script out. Generally speaking, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output">I/O</a> or file reads and writes are more expensive operations.</p>
<p>The tools in this post will help you anticipate how much computing power you have available, monitor your memory consumption more closely and avoid pushing your computer past its limits.
You can do things like reading data in chunks and only using the columns you need to reduce your memory consumption.
Realizing these tools and strategies can make getting things done with Python a smoother ride.</p>

                <p>When assessing your environment, problem or your goal, meticulously scout the tools at your disposal. When you're learning a new job, a new project or a programming language's tools for example, it pays to have a grasp of your options. Researching what documentation, guides, tools or libraries are at your disposal will help you accomplish your goal. That sounds obvious but here's what I mean.</p>
<p>Seek out resources. Bookmark links and support info in an Excel spreadsheet with a handful of columns, for example.
Soon, you'll amass a collection tools and guides to get things done. Most companies or products have &quot;resource centers&quot;,
mountains of internal documentation, tools and blogs. At many organizations, people have likely made tools for something
they needed in the past then moved on. Often these tools can be leveraged for anyone who cares enough to seek out,
read about and learn how to use them. Dig for these tools too. Find resources by googling products you use.
Subscribe to their <a class="reference external" href="https://status.box.com/">status pages</a>. Look for other tools that may help you in a pinch
like <a class="reference external" href="https://support.goto.com/webinar/system-check-attendee">GoToWebinar's system check</a> to help someone figure out what's wrong
with their browser. I love these types of browser-based troubleshooting software. These are ways to gain a better understanding of technologies
that might affect or improve your productivity or day to day goals.</p>
<p>I think of &quot;resource scoping&quot; as crawling these types of resources for every tool, guide and support contact that might good to know. The effort you put in to scope available resources is worth the time spent. Check out the &quot;resource scoping&quot;
I did in <a class="reference external" href="https://lofipython.com/python-libraries-tools-resources-for-creative-and-academic-writers/">this post I wrote focused on tools for writers</a>!</p>
