                </h2>

                
                

                <p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer. Below are some thoughts that may help you decide.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>What are your programming goals? Get a coding job? Create an app or website? Become more productive at your current job?</li>
<li>What is your current experience level? Are you starting fresh or do you already know a language or two?</li>
<li>Do you have money saved up? Otherwise, you might need to take out a loan.</li>
</ol>
<p>A computer science degree is typically most expensive. Coding bootcamps are a lower cost option that pack a wide curriculum
into a few weeks or months, but they can still be pricey. The cheapest option is to take a piecemeal approach through various online courses.</p>
<p><strong>School Advantages</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Wholistic approach. You get the ins and outs of programming from a proven curriculum.</li>
<li>Community. You learn with other students and from experienced teachers.</li>
<li>Job placement. Often various schools and bootcamps will connect you to a company.</li>
<li>Credentials. You gain confidence and the backing of your skills by an established institution.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Potential Downsides</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Tuition Money. A lot of what you need to know is available for free or cheap on the web.</li>
<li>Skill level match. Some bootcamps are oriented for beginners, others are more advanced. If you do a bootcamp, make sure it fits your skill level.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you want a coding job</strong>, school makes sense. The bootcamps look to be effective if you can handle the up-front investment.
It's possible to land a job without schooling but much tougher. I am currently considering <a class="reference external" href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com/">Full Stack Academy</a>.
and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.codingdojo.com/">Coding Dojo</a>. There are many out there. CodeAcademy is a popular route as well.</p>
<p><strong>If you want to make an app or website</strong>, the school or the non-school route may both work. For the non-school route, the following languages are good places to start: <em>(note - not a comprehensive list, these are my picks.)</em></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Web App or Website: HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript</li>
<li>Web App or Website Framework: Flask, Django, py4web, Ruby on Rails, React</li>
<li>iOS app: Swift plus Apple's Xcode environment, Beeware (python library)</li>
<li>Android App: Java or Kotlin, Beeware</li>
<li>General Coding: Python or Ruby</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you want to be more productive at work</strong>, I recommend learning Python. More on Python and where
to start <a class="reference external" href="https://lofipython.com/marketer-slash-programmer/">here</a>. <a class="reference external" href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">Automate the Boring Stuff With Python</a>
is a great resource for boosting your productivity also.</p>
<p>It's not easy to decide whether or not school is for you. I'm still unsure after a year and a half of programming on the side. No matter what, continue to learn multiple languages and strive for a better grasp of the ones you know. Good luck!</p>
<p><strong>My decision: continue self-study and learning online for free.</strong></p>
<p>As of 8 months after writing this post, I have concluded that learning for free online was the right choice for me. I've achieved many of my programming goals in the last three years,
thanks to materials available from <a class="reference external" href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python">Codeacademy</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python">Coursera</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3d-n41Tobw">YouTube</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1720421/how-to-concatenate-two-lists-in-python?rq=1">Stack Overflow</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/">countless helpful resources,</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://pymotw.com/3/glob/index.html">interesting blogs</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html">documentation</a>.
I've talked with others who need the in-person assistance that a bootcamp offers to learn. Do what works for you. Good luck with your decision.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Several years later, I also get paid to use Python and Excel for a living! I studied for free online intermittently over 2 years to achieve it.</p>
