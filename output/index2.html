                <p>You might know you can use the tab key to view the files in a folder one at a time on the command line. However, I recently stumbled into another way to help navigate folders with a lot of files in the command line. Let's say you're looking for a file named &quot;stuff.txt&quot;.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Type &quot;s&quot;.</li>
<li>Hit the tab key.</li>
</ol>
<p>You just jumped right to the files that start with &quot;s&quot;. If there are not many files, you might go straight to &quot;stuff.txt&quot;. The point is that you can jump straight to the letter of your file rather than scrolling through a mountain of files by hitting the tab key 50 times. Once you get to the relative place in the alphabet of your target file, you can scroll forward in the file list with the <strong>tab key</strong> or move backward by pressing <strong>shift + tab</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Multi-Letter Example</strong></p>
<p>Type &quot;st&quot; + tab to target more precise multi-letter sequences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I felt a productive zen when I accidentally realized this little command line quirk can save a lot of time. Especially when you have a folder with 50 or hundreds of files. Of course, you can always type in the file name directly. Using the tab key is very handy to browse if you don't know the exact file name. This is a nice little trick to add to your bag of Windows command line skills!</p>

                <p>Making time to code can be done every day. Carve out those little moments where you can automate tedious tasks or study up on that <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm">hot new Python library</a> that takes your quality to another level.</p>
<p>Take time to reorganize and refactor in <a class="reference external" href="https://atom.io/">your favorite text editor</a>. Break your script, then break it again. Break it until it works. Absorb your new abilities as a machine literate human and build skills on top of skills. Make a breakthrough. The code is great. It makes sense. Another tweak here, another tweak there. Run <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/psf/black">black</a> on it and then have a go at <a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/">PEP-8</a> to brush up on your style. More tweaks, and need to add some <a class="reference external" href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/">docstrings</a> for more clarity.</p>
<p>Another one bites the dust. Who knows where your skills could grow. Following the code is a delightful road. Some days it's hard. Some days it's easy. But it's fulfilling if you treat it like a locksmith does keys. Knowledge is flowing. The craft is built in each moment. Challenges overcome. Battles won. New innovations to munge.</p>
<p>Code is the medium to communicate with machines and leverage their efficiency for convenient means. Tighter the web we weave with transistors and screens, the more we'll need dignified intermediaries of man and machine. Here's to the good code and the bad code we all will write. May we never let something stop our logical flights to code a better dream.</p>

                <p>The first step to offloading a task is writing down how to complete it. Once the process is typed into a lean text file or wiki page, it can be learned by another human. This helps your team, but what's in it for you?</p>

<p>The most selfish programmers probably want to free up their time to focus on more interesting work instead of repetitive processes and maintenance. Therefore, the most selfish programmers should love writing documentation. These types of tasks are somewhat unavoidable, so committing to writing documentation will help you push it over to your teammates.</p>
<p>Write to free yourself of your laundry list of recurring tasks. It's the first step to someone else to be able to step in for you or to delegate to someone else completely. On the plus side, you'll be less reliant on your meaty human brain to remember how to do it. Be selfish, take time to write down how to do your work!</p>

                <p>Yesterday, I experienced a flow state where I became manically obsessed with perfecting a script I was working on. I think it's beautiful code, about 100 lines long without <a class="reference external" href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/">docstrings</a>. It solves a real need and it felt great to write it. Some scripts feel terrible to write and you know they're bad. However, this one felt like one of the best I've ever written.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Flow</a> seems like a mythical, unattainable state these days as portrayed in media, but we can all agree... we love it. When you're in flow, you know it and you feel a grace in improving your work. For coders, maybe it's by wrapping up a few lines here and there into functions. <a class="reference external" href="https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html">Refactoring</a>, reordering, handling loose ends or edge cases, writing docstrings with supporting documentation and clarifying that you really understand what's happening... these things are all mundane at times but critical to writing reliable code.</p>
<p>While doing these typical tasks, you're attaining skill and mastery, one of the highest dopamine hits humans can register legally in all 50 states. You know how much better this iteration of code is than when you first learned to write software. You take bits and pieces from past projects and fit them all together into a cohesive, purposeful program. For example, I was tickled to use Python's <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files">readlines() file reading function</a> to get the last line of a text file. I learned about this function in my first ever free <a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/python">Python course on Coursera</a>, 7 years ago. Thanks again Dr. Chuck!</p>
<p>This time, I realized my flow when researching <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 time format strings</a> and guiding them into an HTTP request with the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/">requests library</a>. A new solution emerged, regurgitated from a prior project and mashed up into a more refined form to satisfy the project's requirements. I combined old and new ideas into a better solution than I had ever thought, a fitting complement for the <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.com/2020/05/18/how-to-make-json-requests-with-python/">API</a> at hand. Time will tell if the solution will actually work as well as I hope.</p>
<p>Flow is real. You can find work that puts you in a flow state, and it doesn't have to be super interesting work to get there. The learning process pays rewards in competency when exposure to different domains combine. Einstein knew a form of this as <a class="reference external" href="https://evernote.com/blog/einsteins-unique-approach-to-thinking/#:~:text=He%20viewed%20taking%20music%20breaks,come%20up%20with%20new%20ideas.">&quot;combinatory play&quot;</a>. Repetition enhances this effect and solidifies your foundation. Flow makes it fun! Only rarely do I feel the highest level of engrossment in my work. I sensed I was flowing on this recent project. You can find these types of challenges too. Keep searching for your flow!</p>

                <p>If you write Python code, there's probably been a time or two when you saw the dreaded <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#MemoryError">&quot;MemoryError&quot;</a>. This happens after one of your Python scripts stops because your computer has no spare <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory">RAM</a> to execute it. I recently experienced this frustration whilst trying to write hundreds of thousands of csv files. However, this time I grasped for tools that support smarter memory management. Now, I can watch my computer's memory bounce around with the Windows Resource Monitor. Python has quite a few memory profiling libraries for monitoring memory too!</p>

<li>Some tools are line oriented, others are function oriented. If your code contains large functions, you might favor a line based profiling tool.</li>
<li>Be aware of the overhead some memory tools may incur. memory_profile was clocked with a whopping 270x slowdown per the Scalene PyCon talk below. The talk shows an awesome comparison of these Python profiling libraries:</li>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>When you'll see &quot;MemoryError&quot; depends on your computer's hardware, the size of your dataset and what operations you need to script out. Generally speaking, <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input/output">I/O</a> or file reads and writes are more expensive operations.</p>
<p>The tools in this post will help you anticipate how much computing power you have available, monitor your memory consumption more closely and avoid pushing your computer past its limits. You can do things like reading data in chunks and only using the columns you need to reduce your memory consumption. Realizing these tools and strategies can make getting things done with Python a smoother ride.</p>

                <p>When assessing your environment, problem or your goal, meticulously scout the tools at your disposal. When you're learning a new job, a new project or a programming language's tools for example, it pays to have a grasp of your options. Researching what documentation, guides, tools or libraries are at your disposal will help you accomplish your goal. That sounds obvious but here's what I mean.</p>
<p>Seek out resources. Bookmark links and support info in an Excel spreadsheet with a handful of columns, for example. Soon, you'll amass a collection tools and guides to get things done. Most companies or products have &quot;resource centers&quot;, mountains of internal documentation, tools and blogs. At many organizations, people have likely made tools for something they needed in the past then moved on. Often these tools can be leveraged for anyone who cares enough to seek out, read about and learn how to use them. Dig for these tools too. Find resources by googling products you use. Subscribe to their <a class="reference external" href="https://status.box.com/">status pages</a>. Look for other tools that may help you in a pinch like <a class="reference external" href="https://support.goto.com/webinar/system-check-attendee">GoToWebinar's system check</a> to help someone figure out what's wrong with their browser. I love these types of browser-based troubleshooting software. These are ways to gain a better understanding of technologies that might affect or improve your productivity or day to day goals.</p>
<p>I think of &quot;resource scoping&quot; as crawling these types of resources for every tool, guide and support contact that might good to know. The effort you put in to scope available resources is worth the time spent. Check out the &quot;resource scoping&quot; I did in <a class="reference external" href="https://pythonmarketer.com/2021/05/29/python-libraries-tools-resources-for-creative-and-academic-writers/">this post I wrote focused on tools for writers</a>!</p>

                <p>This morning I'm meditating on my usual apps or websites I visit through the course of a typical day. I wonder how limited or expansive it could be in the span of all that's waiting to be consumed on the internet. I like reading online or physical books too and writing. Consider your own circle of the internet. What sites do you frequent? What do you consume? This is more rhetorical. It's good to pose the question and consider what you might be missing. I recently downloaded a bunch of nature and hiking apps. Maybe that means I want more of that in my life. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgw_yprN_-w&amp;ab_channel=LiliDVLima">Happy trails</a>.</p>

                <p>In September 2021, I tested out the recommended ads runner, <a class="reference external" href="https://wordads.co/">WordAds</a>, on this WordPress blog. 6,182 ads were served over the course of a month, earning $0.86 from impressions and clicks. My average CPM or cost per thousand impressions was $0.14. My blog averages about 1,600 views a month at the moment, mostly fueled by various search engines. Here's an example of one ad that ran:</p>
<div class="wp-image-6185 figure">

<p class="caption"><strong>Example Ad Run on This Site Shown Above</strong></p>
</div>
<p>In my WordPress account, I upgraded to the business plan. This gave me access to WordPress plug-ins. I enabled the <a class="reference external" href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/">Yoast SEO plug-in</a> and activated its site optimization. I also enabled the maximum ads possible in my settings. In spite of these efforts, the results were sparse. Maybe there's more that I could have done. But this blog is passive and more like a hobby at the moment. I'm ok with a blog that makes $0.86 per month. Maybe someday it will be worth more. But I enjoy writing so it's all good. My skills grow and maybe I share something with someone across the world. That's what keeps me coming back.</p>
<p>I concluded I will not be running ads anytime soon. I wanted to get a baseline of what I was leaving on the table by not running ads. Now I can project when I might tap into the blog's potential traffic revenue, if ever. It seems I would need much higher views per month before ads makes sense with my level of traffic, 65 blog followers and minor social media clout.</p>
<p>There's also the added benefit of not serving up people's data to ad companies. Ads seem to be a generally accepted way to earn from your internet labors. But right now, they're not for this blog. Good luck monetizing your blog. Or just writing for the hell of it!</p>
