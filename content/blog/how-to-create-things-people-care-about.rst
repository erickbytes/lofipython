11 Ideas from people who have created great products, businesses, or ideas:

#. Expertise in a field or product is one of the best assets. Nike's founders started out by making their 
   prototype shoe designs themselves with a waffle iron. `Shoe Dog <https://www.amazon.com/Shoe-Dog-Phil-Knight/dp/1508211809>`__

#. Scratch your own itch. Create the product that you wish existed in
   the world. Write the book you want to read. `Austin Kleon <https://austinkleon.com/steal/>`__ `Indie Hackers <https://www.indiehackers.com/>`__

#. Observe a problem or inconvenience that exists in the world and create a better solution. - Product Development Class

#. Find a niche and create something useful for that segment of people. `Seth Godin <http://sethgodin.typepad.com/>`__

#. For every attribute, there is an opposite, effective attribute. `Law 14 of the 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing <https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/business/the-22-immutable-laws-marketing/>`__

#. Launch quickly, show to people, get feedback, and iterate your idea. `Rework <https://37signals.com/rework>`__

#. Use combinatory play. Take ideas from different disciplines and combine them to bring about new ideas. `Brain Pickings <https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/08/14/how-einstein-thought-combinatorial-creativity/>`__

#. Invest in improving your product versus marketing. A great product is obvious to a potential customer. `Seth Godin <http://sethgodin.typepad.com/>`__

#. People remember how you or your product made them feel versus cost.

#. An idea doesn't have to be revolutionary. Many new businesses or products take an existing 
   product and make a slight modification or add a new twist.

#. Many of the successful people during the gold rush sold pick-axes to the miners.
