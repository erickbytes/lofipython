Hi,

These days, starting a business is so easy that it has become a great option for a side gig.

Ecommerce businesses, especially, are great for anyone who wants to test the entrepreneurial waters or set up a potential passive income stream. But as with any business, the key to success in ecommerce is creating loyal, happy customers.

It’s a topic I’d love to write about for your website, if you’re interested. In the article, I’ll offer tips for ecommerce entrepreneurs or wannabe entrepreneurs on how they can attract first-time customers and turn them into loyal shoppers. I'll include a tip on hiring a web designer to put together an attractive, easy-to-navigate website, and will plug in your services.

Please let me know if this topic is of interest and I’ll get started on the article.
