There is no one-size-fits-all answer. Below are some thoughts that may help you decide.

#. What are your programming goals? Get a coding job? Create an app or website? Become more productive at your current job?
#. What is your current experience level? Are you starting fresh or do you already know a language or two?
#. Do you have money saved up? Otherwise, you might need to take out a loan.

A computer science degree is typically most expensive. Coding bootcamps are a lower cost option that pack a wide curriculum 
into a few weeks or months, but they can still be pricey. The cheapest option is to take a piecemeal approach through various online courses.

**School Advantages**

-  Wholistic approach. You get the ins and outs of programming from a proven curriculum.
-  Community. You learn with other students and from experienced teachers.
-  Job placement. Often various schools and bootcamps will connect you to a company.
-  Credentials. You gain confidence and the backing of your skills by an established institution.

**Potential Downsides**

-  Tuition Money. A lot of what you need to know is available for free or cheap on the web.
-  Skill level match. Some bootcamps are oriented for beginners, others are more advanced. If you do a bootcamp, make sure it fits your skill level.

**If you want a coding job**, school makes sense. The bootcamps look to be effective if you can handle the up-front investment. 
It's possible to land a job without schooling but much tougher. I am currently considering `Full Stack Academy <https://www.fullstackacademy.com/>`__. 
and `Coding Dojo <http://www.codingdojo.com/>`__. There are many out there. CodeAcademy is a popular route as well.

**If you want to make an app or website**, the school or the non-school route may both work. For the non-school route, the following languages are good places to start: *(note - not a comprehensive list, these are my picks.)*

-  Web App or Website: HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript
-  Web App or Website Framework: Flask, Django, py4web, Ruby on Rails, React
-  iOS app: Swift plus Apple's Xcode environment, Beeware (python library)
-  Android App: Java or Kotlin, Beeware
-  General Coding: Python or Ruby

**If you want to be more productive at work**, I recommend learning Python. More on Python and where 
to start `here <https://lofipython.com/marketer-slash-programmer/>`__. `Automate the Boring Stuff With Python <https://automatetheboringstuff.com/>`__ 
is a great resource for boosting your productivity also.

It's not easy to decide whether or not school is for you. I'm still unsure after a year and a half of programming on the side. No matter what, continue to learn multiple languages and strive for a better grasp of the ones you know. Good luck!

**My decision: continue self-study and learning online for free.**

As of 8 months after writing this post, I have concluded that learning for free online was the right 
choice for me. I've achieved many of my programming goals in the last three years, 
thanks to materials available from `Codeacademy <https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python>`__, 
`Coursera <https://www.coursera.org/learn/python>`__, `YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3d-n41Tobw>`__, 
`Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1720421/how-to-concatenate-two-lists-in-python?rq=1>`__, 
`countless helpful resources, <https://automatetheboringstuff.com/>`__, `interesting blogs <https://pymotw.com/3/glob/index.html>`__, 
and `documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html>`__. I've talked with others who need the in-person assistance that a bootcamp offers to learn. Do what works for you. Good luck with your decision.

**Update:** Several years later, I also get paid to use Python and Excel for a living! I studied for free online intermittently over 2 years to achieve it.
