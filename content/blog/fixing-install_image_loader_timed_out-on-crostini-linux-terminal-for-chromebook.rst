When booting up the Ubuntu shell on my Chromebook, it usually just works. However, After I updated 
to a new version of Chromebook OS, I was getting this error:

   vmshell failed: 
      Error starting crostini for terminal: 
         52 (INSTALL_IMAGE_LOADER_TIMED_OUT)

First, I restarted my Chromebook but the error persisted after restarting. So I turned to Bing Copilot:

**Open Crosh: ctrl + alt + T**

**Stop The Termina Container in Crosh**

.. code:: console

   vmc stop termina


**Start The Termina Container in Crosh**

.. code:: console

   vmc start termina


The vmc command is used to manage Linux containers from Crosh. After I entered these two vmc commands, 
the error was resolved. My Crostini Linux shell is functional again!
