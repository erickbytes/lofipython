| Hi Erick,
| Regarding AUTOMATING PYTEST ON WINDOWS WITH A .BAT FILE, PYTHON, TASK SCHEDULER (https://pythonmarketer.com/2020/03/21/automating-pytest-on-windows-with-a-bat-file-python-task-scheduler-and-box/)
| I created a bat-file and scheduled execution according to your instructions. bat-file is triggered and command prompt is appeared for a fraction of a second and then disappeared. 'Test_Results.txt' is created but is empty.
| What possible problems could be?
| Thanks in advance
