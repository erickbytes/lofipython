**Update: Mozilla has chosen to sunset its Pocket app. As of July 8th 2025, Pocket will be shut down.**

I really enjoyed using `Pocket <https://help.getpocket.com/>`__ as my primary reading app on my cell phone. My top need is to download articles I find on the internet for offline viewing. This app does that and more in a smooth interface. This review reflects the perspective of using the `Pocket Android version <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideashower.readitlater.pro>`__ 8.1.1.0, pictured here:

The Pocket app is an overall great product and I felt compelled to endorse it here for the 
satisfaction it brought me. It has increased my reading throughput. 
It was perfect for when you found yourself without an internet connection, in sparsely populated areas, 
on an airplane or while traveling in foreign countries. Goodbye, pocket. You will be missed.
