Most new skills I've tried to learn seem to follow a similar trajectory:

-  **Stage One - Beginner's Thrill:** A rapid growth and learning pace at the beginning, because I'm conquering a lot of small goals, diving into something new and there are rapid gains which feels great.

-  **Stage Two - Amateur's Reality:** The pace of learning and accomplishment levels off. I'm still learning, but the leaps forward start following a plateau trajectory. This stage is not as rewarding as the first. The key is to push through and jump to the next plateau and keep improving.

-  **Stage Three - Mastery:** This is the goal with most things I want to learn, and if I gain enough experience and skill, I'll have the ability to apply the new things I've learned to accomplish my goals.

This is my own way of paraphrasing what I've read a million times on the internet - put in the hours, stay focused and don't stop trying. Right now I'm somewhere around stage one/two with Python. Gotta keep pushing forward. (This blog is also serving as a pep talk to myself.)
