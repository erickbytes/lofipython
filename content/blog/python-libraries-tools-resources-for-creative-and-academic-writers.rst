   In Math, Computer Science, Physics, or any field where your typical paper has even a modest amount of mathematical notation the percentage of papers written using LaTeX (or even plain TeX!) is probably about 90%+.

   BibTeX is reference management software for formatting lists of references. The BibTeX tool is typically used together with the LaTeX document preparation system.
