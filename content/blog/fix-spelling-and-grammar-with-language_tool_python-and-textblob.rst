Below are two practical Python libraries for text processing. This function uses `textblob's spelling correction <https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/api_reference.html?highlight=correct#textblob.blob.TextBlob.correct>`__ along with `language_tool_python <https://pypi.org/project/language-tool-python/>`__, which applies grammatical corrections via the `Language Tool API <https://languagetool.org/http-api/swagger-ui/#!/default/post_check>`__. I added these text processing transformations into my `concept text generation app <https://www.positivipy.com/>`__. These are free, public APIs up to around 20 requests per second. You can send both text and receive back an improved version of your text, ideally altering and improving your writing.

I found 2 errors when I piped the text of this post into the below code: the proper noun "textblob" corrected to "text blow's" and the word "app" corrected to "pp". Be sure to proof your results. Regardless, I like having these two Python tools in my bag!

`Install textblob <https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/install.html>`__\ **and**\ `language_tool_python <https://pypi.org/project/language-tool-python/>`__\ **with these**\ `pip <https://pythonmarketer.com/2018/01/20/how-to-python-pip-install-new-libraries/>`__\ **commands:**

.. code:: python

   pip install language-tool-python

.. code:: python

   pip install -U textblob
   python -m textblob.download_corpora

.. code-block:: python

   import language_tool_python
   from textblob import TextBlob

   def fix_spelling_and_grammar(text):
       """Returns str: text transformed by language tool and text blob

       try:
           # use the public API, language English
           tool = language_tool_python.LanguageToolPublicAPI('en-US')
           text =  tool.correct(text)
           b = TextBlob(text)
           return str(b.correct())
       except:
           return text

   text = "Language is incredble. Fascinatng how hoomans have so many."
   transformed_text = fix_spelling_and_grammar(text)
   print(transformed_text)
   # >>> Language is incredible. Fascinating how humans have so many.
