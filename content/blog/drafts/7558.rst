Some humans prefer to use the command line or "command prompt" on a computer. I'm definitely amazed with what can be done on the Linux operating system. Windows now has `Windows Subsystem for Linux <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about>`__ in addition to its built-in command prompt and PowerShell. Most major operating systems have a shell environment where you can run tools like Python. On my Chromebook, it's crosh, which also has a bash terminal that can be accessed from within crosh.

I really enjoy using the command line to do things. However, it's just another option of many. Sometimes, the best tool for the problem needs a GUI or browser based environment. So why not launch the GUI with a command line like VSCode? The command prompt is incredible.

Don't give this tool much elevated status, it's another means to get things done at your disposal. Some people are more used to navigating a shell than others and that's ok. Eventually, you'll be a seasoned veteran.

   It is named a shellÂ **because it is the outermost layer around the operating system**.
