Tonight, I made a list of 15 things I've observed after 4 years of study
at the University of Illinois and 4 years of professional experience in
Marketing. So here they are:

#. It's easier to sell one thing than several different products.

#. Distribution = Very Important (Duh!)

#. Marketing depends a lot on product quality - what can you do for the
   user/customer? What problems can you solve? 
   `Seth Godin <http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2016/02/fit-and-finish.html>`__ talks
   about this quite often.

#. Design matters - in product, communications, and everything else in
   this world.

#. Sell benefits, not features.

#. People are emotional buyers.

#. The more you know about your customer, the better.

#. Budget and resources matter.

#. There can be an extremely wide variance from industry to industry -
   the key is to look for parallels.

#. Humanize your company as much as possible - `This is a great example
   <http://members.cdbaby.com/shipping-confirmation.aspx>`__.

#. You're more likely to find success with talented people around you.

#. Be aware of the\ `Pareto Principle
   <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle>`__ (The 80/20 Rule)
   - 80% of results often come from 20% of customers.

#. Ads that annoy / shout about your product don't work; Ads that tell
   customers useful information or help them in some way do.

#. There is such a thing as too many choices for the customer - it
   overwhelms them.

#. Practice brevity. Whatever you've got to say, do it in fewer words.
