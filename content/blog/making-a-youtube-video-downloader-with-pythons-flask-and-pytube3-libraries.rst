How do you download YouTube videos? The easiest answer is to google sites like `y2mate <https://y2mate.guru/en8/>`__ that work for downloading videos. But then I thought, I wonder if I can make something?

Boredom, my curiosity and some googling turned up the `pytube3 library <https://github.com/get-pytube/pytube3>`__, "A lightweight, dependency-free Python 3 library (and command-line utility) for downloading YouTube Videos." Lo and behold, 3 hours of experimentation later, I made a video downloader with Python. ðŸ˜ƒ

I used pytube3 with `Flask <https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/>`__ and `pythonanywhere <https://www.pythonanywhere.com/>`__ to accomplish the task. I was pleasantly surprised at how it came together and simply worked! I'm really not that familiar with Flask either. Here's how to make a primitive YouTube video downloader.

**Install the pytube library in the pythonanywhere bash console with**\ `pip <https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/01/20/how-to-python-pip-install-new-libraries/>`__

``pip3.8 install --user pytube3 --upgrade``

**If you're not using pythonanywhere, install Flask (it's already included in pythonanywhere)**

``python -m pip install flask``

**Minimum Viable Prototype Achieved**

This is more of a proof of concept than workable solution. It works for many videos I tried. It occasionally had trouble downloading certain videos. I tested it successfully on videos of up to 10 minutes. Maybe it works more consistently if the file size is smaller? Or there is a bug on certain types of videos? For me, some videos of only a few minutes failed, so your results may vary. The videos that failed returned errors like ``KeyError: 'cipher'`` and ``KeyError: 'url'``.

**Honorable Mentions**

`youtube-dl <https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/README.md#installation>`__: Command-line program to download videos from YouTube.com and other video sites

`YoutubeDownload <https://github.com/YouTubeDownload/YouTubeDownload>`__: GUI and CLI for downloading YouTube video/audio
