Here are 20 random technology-oriented Wikipedia links I recently collected after re-organizing troves of bookmarked links 
accumulated over the past few years. These articles peek into the wide variety of things to learn about that exist in Computer Science. 
ABL. Always. Be. Learning. Curiosity and well organized browser bookmarks are your friend.

I support Wikipedia with a donation nearly every year. It's an amazing resource to learn about everything and I'm very grateful for it. 
Thank you for existing, Wikipedia. It's is a great jumping off point to learn about something I don't understand, which is much of this list here.

Algorithms & Theories
---------------------

`Deterministic algorithm <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm>`__

`Greater fool theory <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS>`__ (economics)

`Man or boy test <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_or_boy_test>`__ - compiler theory from Donald Knuth

`Recursion <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion>`__ - the most common algorithm I read about in passing

Databases
---------

`Cache <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)>`_

`Cache invalidation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_invalidation>`_

   Caching is a common technique to store data so that it can be quickly fetched later with limited usage of database resources.

`Column-oriented DBMS: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS>`_

`Data definition language <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_definition_language#:~:text=In%20the%20context%20of%20SQL,tables%2C%20indexes%2C%20and%20users.>`__

`Database normalization <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization>`__

`Lock <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)>`__ (mutex)

`Hybrid transactional/analytical processing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_transactional/analytical_processing>`__ (HTAP)

`Online transaction processing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing>`__ (OLTP) - Making lots of writes to the database.

`Online analytical processing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing>`__ (OLAP) - Reading the database. Lots of joins.

Developer
---------

`Asynchrony <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming)>`__ Used for performing operations in parallel.

`RPC <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call>`_

`Event-driven programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming#:~:text=In%20computer%20programming%2C%20event%2Ddriven,from%20other%20programs%20or%20threads.>`_

   Async is always event-driven, but not the other way round.

   \ `Stephen Chung - Stack Overflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5844955/whats-the-difference-between-event-driven-and-asynchronous-between-epoll-and-a#:~:text=Asynchronous%20is%20basically%20multitasking.,in%20an%20easy%20responsive%20manner.>`__\ 

`Functional Programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming>`__

`Garbage collection <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)>`__ - automatic memory management

`Parallel Computing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing#:~:text=Parallel%20computers%20can%20be%20roughly,work%20on%20the%20same%20task.>`__

`Reinforcement learning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning>`__ - one paradigm of machine learning

`Remote procedure call <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call>`__

`List of Lists of Lists <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runbook#:~:text=In%20a%20computer%20system%20or,or%20in%20physical%20book%20form.>`__ - check out the "Technology" section

Final Reminders
---------------

-  check out the `Wikipedia python library <https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/>`__ (import wikipedia)
-  `Random <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random>`__ - Wikipedia's Random Article Button
-  And now for something completely different: `Useful Links for Javascript Developers <https://github.com/yuandongzhong/useful-links-for-javascript>`__
