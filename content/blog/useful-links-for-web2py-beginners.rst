As I've been grappling with web2py, I've found a lot of useful posts and sites that have helped me along the way:

-  `How to Deploy Your App to PythonAnywhere <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/web2py/IURWDAP2eTY>`__: So easy it's amazing. I've already deployed an app to see if I could.

-  On CSS, I found `this <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/web2py/cFc5NPQmmhc>`__ and `this <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7184489/web2py-linking-to-css>`__ useful.
   I've learned a tiny amount of CSS, `thanks to Colleen van Lent <https://www.coursera.org/learn/introcss/>`__.
   I'm now able to manipulate the layout of my apps.

-  An Easy Way to `Customize Forms <http://web2py.com/book/default/chapter/07#Custom-forms>`__

-  `web2py Cheat Sheet <http://web2py.com/examples/static/web2py_cheatsheet.pdf>`__

-  `URL Mapping Notes <https://joecodeswell.wordpress.com/2011/06/09/web2py-url-mapping/>`__ I'm still understanding how the URL function works in web2py but it's very powerful from what I have gathered.

-  `DAL Quick Reference Guide <https://joecodeswell.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/web2py-dal-quick-reference/>`__

**Update:** 
consider using `py4web <https://github.com/web2py/py4web>`__, web2py's successor

-  py4web documentation: `The database abstraction layer (DAL) <https://py4web.com/_documentation/static/en/chapter-05.html>`__

-  py4web documentation: `Installation and Startup <https://py4web.com/_documentation/static/en/chapter-01.html#>`__

-  Bonus: `How to Make Mistakes in Python <http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/how-to-make-mistakes-in-python.csp>`__ Free for download.
