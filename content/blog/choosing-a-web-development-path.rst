I have recently finished this `HTML course <https://www.coursera.org/learn/html>`__, which recommends using cPanel
to configure websites. So I bought a domain and registered with cPanel.

-  **What I thought would happen in trying to create a
   website/app:**\ Buy a domain and use cPanel and Python in perfect
   sync to create a website.

-  **Reality:**\ cPanel is configured mostly for PHP. You can run Python
   scripts with it, but it doesn't seem to be the most effective route
   from what I've read.

So I went back to the drawing board and I've simplified this down to two
basic paths:

+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| Options    | Languages                                                     | Hosting                                       | Framework / IDE                     |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| **Path 1** | Build a website using Python + Python Web Frameworks and HTML | PythonAnywhere or other Python friendly hosts | `web2py <http://www.web2py.com/>`__ |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+
| **Path 2** | Use a combo of HTML, Javascript + Python, other languages     | cPanel, many other hosts                      | None (AKA I'm not sure)             |
+------------+---------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------+

I'm going with Path 1 because the only language I know is Python. I hope
to learn other languages like Javascript and CSS but would like to get
building as fast as possible.

I found a free web hosting service called PythonAnywhere. There are
other `free <https://wiki.python.org/moin/FreeHosts>`__ and paid Python-friendly hosts.

Instead of the `previously mentioned web frameworks <https://lofipython.com/starting-to-almost-kinda-think-about-creating-a-web-app/>`__,
I've chosen web2py as a starter because of its compatibility with PythonAnywhere, its simplicity, easy to read documentation and relative
ease of use for beginners.

-  A note on PythonAnywhere: they get 5 stars for the tutorial pictured
   below. It is very nice to see in the whirlwind of confusion of
   learning to deal with code and a new environment.

++ Love this opening quote from `web2py Documentation
<http://web2py.com/book>`__: "I believe that the ability to easily build
high quality web applications is of critical importance for the growth
of a free and open society. This prevents the biggest players from
monopolizing the flow of information."

+++ A note on web2py so far: `the videos from the creator
<http://www.web2py.com/init/default/documentation>`__, Massimo Di
Pierro, are super useful!

   **Update:** consider using `py4web
   <https://github.com/web2py/py4web>`__, web2py's successor
