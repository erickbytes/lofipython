This blog is formerly known as "Python Marketer" from 2016 to 2023. In May 2023, I've begun the migration from Wordpress's "Personal" plan to a free Pelican static site via the Pelican Python library. 100 posts are now hosted here exclusively on lofipython.com. I will be posting my projects, Python explorations and tech musings here going forward. Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy these Python musings.

**The Next Chapter: Lo-Fi Python**

A Python static site blog generated with the Pelican Python library and hosted with Cloudflare Pages.

> Lo-fi (also typeset as lofi or low-fi; short for low fidelity) is a music or production quality in which elements usually regarded as imperfections in the context of a recording or performance are present, sometimes as a deliberate choice. *Wikipedia*

**The Spirit of Low Fidelity**

Lo-Fi Python aims to find the "lo-fi" spirit of Python.
Doing more with less. Favoring the standard library. Lowest possible time to MVP (minimum viable product).
Learning new libraries. Exploring the ecosystem with playful curiosity.
Embrace helping others by helping yourself. This is the way.
