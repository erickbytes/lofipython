I usually find a lot of these tools from viewing GitHub's `trending repositories <https://github.com/trending>`__. When I find a novel repo, I'll `star <https://github.com/erickbytes?tab=stars>`__ it to remember for later. This is a list of free, open source software spanning security, AI, cloud, HTTP, JSON, monitoring, dev ops and more.

I enjoy finding and cataloging new packages as much as using them sometimes. Some of these I'll never use. By filing them away, I can recall in it the future if I am faced with a problem that they can solve. Enjoy!
