A static site generator creates static HTML and markdown files to serve as a website. They're commonly used to host blogs but not exclusively. I recently researched my options to roll a static site in Python. I'm assessing a few of them as a potential future self-hosted blogging solution for this Wordpress blog. Or maybe I'll spin up a new one!

   **Why Statics?**

   Most "modern" websites are *dynamic* in the sense that the contents of the site live in a database, and are converted into presentation-ready HTML only when a user wants to see the page. That's great. However, it presents some minor issues that static site generators try to solve.

   In a static site, the whole site, every page, *everything*, is created before the first user even sees it and uploaded to the server as a simple folder full of HTML files (and images, CSS, etc).

Enjoying the modular nature of the `pelican-plugins <https://github.com/pelican-plugins>`__ and `pelican-themes <https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes>`__!

**Lektor** \| `Github - 3.5K Stars <https://github.com/lektor/lektor>`__

Intriguing CMS project touting a "Python API", `plugins for tools like Webpack <https://www.getlektor.com/plugins/>`__ and talented maintainers including the author of Flask.

**Cactus** \| `Github - 3.5K stars <https://github.com/eudicots/Cactus>`__

"Simple but powerful `static website generator <http://mickgardner.com/2011/04/27/An-Introduction-To-Static-Site-Generators.html>`__ using Python and the `Django template system <http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/>`__... typical users would be designers that are tech-savvy, want to use templates, but don't like to mess with setting up django or S3."

-  One convenient way to serve your static files up on the web is with a `CDN <https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/what-is-a-cdn/#:~:text=A%20content%20delivery%20network%20(CDN,stylesheets%2C%20images%2C%20and%20videos.>`__ like `Cloudflare Pages <https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-anything/>`__.
-  You can research more projects on `Jamstack <https://jamstack.org/generators/>`__, a site I found helpful for finding these libraries.

**Update**! I launched a Pelican blog about investing with Cloudflare pages. It's my first live static blog. Read more about it `here <https://lofipython/launching-a-live-static-blog-via-pelican-github-and-cloudflare-pages/>`__.
