**Write More Code**

Write code everyday. Code fast and break things. Cherish your tracebacks. Keep going back, no matter how hopeless it may seem. Code habitually. Learn how to code. Get better at code. Love code.

**Write Less Code**

Use as few lines as possible. Nothing looks better than a program shorter than 50 or 100 lines! Avoid aggressively gnarly one-liners. Use sensible one-liners or [*gasp*] for loops. Read other people's code.

Write more code, write less code.
