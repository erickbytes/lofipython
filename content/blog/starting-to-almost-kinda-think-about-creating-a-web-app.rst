One of my first goals when I started learning Python was to build a web application. Once you've gotten a basic grip on Python, you might be ready to learn about web frameworks. A web framework consists of software designed to aid in web development. They make it easier to create a website or web app - if you know how to use them. Unfortunately, there is a learning curve to using the frameworks but thankfully there is plenty o' documentation to go around to help you.

Here are the two `Python Frameworks <https://www.airpair.com/python/posts/django-flask-pyramid>`__ I've chosen to investigate (there are many out here on the webs):

-  Django - widely used, great community support, comes with just about everything built in. Can be used for smaller apps or multi-page/app websites.
-  Flask - a "microframework" used for smaller apps. Possibly more manageable for someone beginning a smaller project (me!)

So as a beginnerish-level coder, I've chosen to start with Flask; I also found `this sweet guide <http://opentechschool.github.io/python-flask/>`__ that I think will help. Maybe someday I will graduate to Django, it sounds like a great framework. I've also decided that first I need to `brush up on my HTML <https://www.coursera.org/specializations/web-design>`__ - And according to a lot of what I've read it doesn't hurt to know CSS/Javascript. So this whole "build a web app" idea will continue, albeit with some hurdles to clear first.

Edit: I ended up choosing web2py, which I hadn't even considered when I wrote this originally! Here's a `post about why I chose it <https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/03/22/choosing-a-web-development-path/>`__.
