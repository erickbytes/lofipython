You may want to `download an archive <https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/how-to-download-your-twitter-archive>`__ of your tweets before deleting them. I did this and it took about a day to get my archive download.

**How To Purge Your Tweet History with Python**

#. Per the `Tweepy library documentation <http://docs.tweepy.org/en/latest/install.html>`__, install tweepy with `pip <https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/01/20/how-to-python-pip-install-new-libraries/>`__. It worked fine in my python 3.8 `virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`__.

.. code:: wp-block-code

   pip install tweepy

2. Sign up for a `Twitter Developer account <https://developer.twitter.com/>`__ and create an app. I named mine "tweetcleanr".

3. Find your app under "Projects & Apps". Edit your app's permissions to "**Read + Write + Direct Messages**".

4. After you update your permissions, select the "Keys and tokens" tab. Then regenerate new API keys. Then paste them in the below script.

5. Save the below script as a python file. In command prompt or terminal, run python **delete_tweets.py** or whatever you want to name it!

6. You'll be asked to go to a link and enter an authorization code. Then you'll see your tweets being deleted like pictured below.

**delete_tweets.py**

I found this `Github Gist <https://gist.github.com/davej/113241>`__ via Google and updated the print and input statements to Python 3. I also added the `traceback module <https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html>`__ in case you need to debug it. Initially, I received an error telling me to complete step 3 above. I didn't see the error message at first, until adding ``traceback.print_exc()`` like you see below.

   import tweepy
   import traceback

**âœ…** **Twitter Cleanse Complete**

Twitter has a really slick developer dashboard. Its API combined with the tweepy library got the job done for me. It's great when stuff just works. And it only cost me about 1 hour to complete. Time to start a clean slate. Here's to looking forward.
