As I've been grappling with web2py, I've found a lot of useful posts and sites that have helped me along the way:

-   [How to Deploy Your App to PythonAnywhere](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/web2py/IURWDAP2eTY): So easy it's amazing. I've already deployed an app to see if I could.
-   For CSS - I found [this](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/web2py/cFc5NPQmmhc) and [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7184489/web2py-linking-to-css) useful. I've learned a tiny amount of CSS ([Thanks to Colleen van Lent!](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introcss/)) but am now able to manipulate the layout of my apps.
-   An Easy Way to [Customize Forms](http://web2py.com/book/default/chapter/07#Custom-forms)
-   [web2py Cheat Sheet](http://web2py.com/examples/static/web2py_cheatsheet.pdf)
-   [URL Mapping Notes](https://joecodeswell.wordpress.com/2011/06/09/web2py-url-mapping/) - I'm still understanding how the URL function works in web2py but it's very powerful from what I have gathered.
-   [DAL Quick Reference Guide](https://joecodeswell.wordpress.com/2011/05/25/web2py-dal-quick-reference/)

**Update:** consider using [py4web](https://github.com/web2py/py4web), web2py's successor

-   py4web documentation: [The database abstraction layer (DAL)](https://py4web.com/_documentation/static/en/chapter-05.html)
-   py4web documentation: [Installation and Startup](https://py4web.com/_documentation/static/en/chapter-01.html#)
-   Bonus: [How to Make Mistakes in Python](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/how-to-make-mistakes-in-python.csp) - Free for download.
