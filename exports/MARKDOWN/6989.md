Traversing a tree of folders can be done many ways in Python. Here is one approach that worked for me using pathlib, list comprehensions and [os.scandir()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.scandir). I was able to use pathlib and the os module to get a list of all files and subfolders up to two levels below a top level folder.

The inspiration to use os.scandir() came from [this Stack Overflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/973473/getting-a-list-of-all-subdirectories-in-the-current-directory). It is well documented as the most performant way to get a list of items in a folder. List comprehensions are also often acknowledged as a faster way to loop through iterators. Note how we can use pathlib's is_file() and is_dir() finctions within the list comprehensions to find either the subfolders or subfiles.

I'm satisfied with this code because I've tried to do this before but failed to get other strategies to work. It gets the job done and uses some clever, Pythonic pieces: pathlib, os.scandir() and two list comprehensions. There may be a better way, but I'm happy with this one for now!

import os
from pathlib import Path


def crawl_folder(path):
    """Get a list of sub-folders and sub-files from top level folder.
    Accepts: pathlib path object
    Returns: subfolders and file names as 2 lists
    """
    subfolders = [item.path for item in os.scandir(path) if item.is_dir()]
    file_names = list()
    for subfolder in subfolders:
        files = [item.path for item in os.scandir(subfolder)]
        file_names += files
        sub_sub_folders = [item.path for item in os.scandir(subfolder) if item.is_dir()]
        for subfolder in sub_sub_folders:
            files = [item.path for item in os.scandir(subfolder)]
            file_names += files
    subfolders += sub_sub_folders
    return subfolders, file_names


# specify full path if folder not in the same folder as script
folder = Path.cwd() / "Folder_Name"
path = Path(folder)
subfolders, file_names = crawl_folder(path)
with open("Crawled_Files.txt", "w") as fhand:
    for f in sorted(file_names):
        line = f + "\n"
        fhand.write(line)
```
