Sometimes, we find ourselves on a public Wi-Fi connection that is "connected", but unable to get to the login page. While the login page is triggered automatically on most mobile devices, computers may not connect so easily. As usual, I turned to Google to find a way to get to a public Wi-Fi login page.

[This helpful Zapier blog post](https://zapier.com/blog/open-wifi-login-page/#:~:text=An%20easy%20trick%20is%20to,you're%20at%20home).) outlines a few different approaches you can take. My solution below is one of the IP addresses they suggested trying. Decide if you need to edit your computer's network settings. Alternatively, you may just need to find the public login page. I was able to load my public Wi-Fi login page with this IP address in my web browser:

`<!-- /wp:paragraph -->`{=html}

`<!-- wp:code -->`{=html}

``` wp-block-code
192.168.1.11
```

`<!-- /wp:code -->`{=html}

`<!-- wp:image {"id":7279,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->`{=html}

This is a fun little trick to keep in mind if you're having difficulty connecting to public Wi-Fi. Problem solved!
