You read the whole thing front to back? Every word? Stop and think about it. What is the computer trying to tell you?

`<!-- /wp:paragraph -->`{=html}

Sometimes something is obvious but needs to be reminded. I found myself thinking this yet again today. Often there are times where I would have saved some time and grief by carefully reading the error.

`<!-- /wp:paragraph -->`{=html}

Carefully read the error when you see a traceback. Then once you've taken it all in, consider what to do next. If you're stumped, googling it might yield a solution. But make sure you actually read the error first.
