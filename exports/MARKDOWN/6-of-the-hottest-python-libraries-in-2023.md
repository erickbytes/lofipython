Here's a short list of Python packages making a splash this year:

`<!-- wp:list -->`{=html}

-   [pyscript](https://pyscript.net/): execute Python code in your web browser
-   [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff): code linting package built with Rust and Python
-   [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): a rapidly adopted web framework for building APIs
-   [polars](https://www.pola.rs/): high performance pandas drop in replacement, also built with Rust and Python
-   [buzz](https://github.com/chidiwilliams/buzz): Python package that accesses the Whisper API's text transcription of audio
-   [tomllib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tomllib.html): new in the Python 3.11 standard library. It's quietly picking up steam amongst Python developers. Tom's Obvious Minimal Language, TOML, "[a config file format for humans](https://toml.io/en/)"

**Python + Rust = High Performance**

A common theme I've noticed is the emergence of Rust as a performance complement to Python code. It seems we can expect modularity between the two languages to strengthen their collective abilities.

**Python is still growing and evolving**.

It's great to see. Including the ability to parse TOML config files in the standard library is a vote of confidence by the Python community. I will now seek to use TOML in my own projects.

**Web frameworks and web browsers are king.**

FastAPI is the new option in a space dominated by Flask and Django. Web frameworks allow developers to quickly create websites.

Running Python in a browser has been a movement in recent years. First Pyodide, WASM euphoria, and now a Python library that takes Python in a browser to new levels. Excited to see where these projects go and what new buzzy libraries will emerge this year!
