Today's discovery is [Python Koans](https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans). According to [python-guide.org](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/intro/learning/), Koans "uses a test-driven approach, q.v. TEST DRIVEN DESIGN SECTION to provide an interactive tutorial teaching basic Python concepts. By fixing assertion statements that fail in a test script, this provides sequential steps to learning Python."

I was also curious what a "Koan" actually is: "a paradox to be meditated upon that is used to train Zen Buddhist monks to abandon ultimate dependence on reason and to force them into gaining sudden intuitive enlightenment" - Merriam-Webster

Koans takes a little work to install. [Pygorithm](https://github.com/OmkarPathak/pygorithm) is an similar package for learning advanced more algorithm theories with python, and can be more easily installed by [pip](https://github.com/OmkarPathak/pygorithm).
