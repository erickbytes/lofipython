There is no one-size-fits-all answer. Below are some thoughts that may help you decide.

1.  What are your programming goals? Get a coding job? Create an app or website? Become more productive at your current job?
2.  What is your current experience level? Are you starting fresh or do you already know a language or two?
3.  Do you have money saved up? Otherwise, you might need to take out a loan.

A computer science degree is typically most expensive. Coding bootcamps are a lower cost option that pack a wide curriculum into a few weeks or months, but they can still be pricey. The cheapest option is to take a piecemeal approach through various online courses.

**School Advantages**

-   Wholistic approach. You get the ins and outs of programming from a proven curriculum.
-   Community. You learn with other students and from experienced teachers.
-   Job placement. Often various schools and bootcamps will connect you to a company.
-   Credentials. You gain confidence and the backing of your skills by an established institution.

**[Potential Downsides]{style="line-height:1.7;"}**

-   [Tuition Money. A lot of ]{style="line-height:1.7;"}[what you need to know is available for free or cheap on the web.]{style="line-height:1.7;"}
-   Skill level match. Some bootcamps are oriented for beginners, others are more advanced. If you do a bootcamp, make sure it fits your skill level.

**If you want a coding job**, school makes sense. The bootcamps look to be effective if you can handle the up-front investment. It's possible to land a job without schooling but much tougher. I am currently considering [Full Stack Academy](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/). and [Coding Dojo](http://www.codingdojo.com/). There are many out there. CodeAcademy is a popular route as well.

**If you want to make an app or website**, the school or the non-school route may both work. For the non-school route, the following languages are good places to start: *(note - not a comprehensive list, these are my picks.)*

-   Web App or Website: HTML, CSS, Python, Javascript
-   Web App or Website Framework:  Flask, Django, py4web, Ruby on Rails, React
-   iOS app: Swift plus Apple's Xcode environment, Beeware (python library)
-   Android App: Java or Kotlin, Beeware
-   General Coding: Python or Ruby

**If you want to be more productive at work**, I recommend learning Python. More on Python and where to start [here](https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2016/02/22/marketer-slash-programmer/). [Automate the Boring Stuff With Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) is a great resource for boosting your productivity also.

It's not easy to decide whether or not school is for you. I'm still unsure after a year and a half of programming on the side. No matter what, continue to learn multiple languages and strive for a better grasp of the ones you know. Good luck!

**My decision: continue self-study and learning online for free.**

As of 8 months after writing this post, I have concluded that learning for free online was the right choice for me. I've achieved many of my programming goals in the last three years, thanks to materials available from [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3d-n41Tobw), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1720421/how-to-concatenate-two-lists-in-python?rq=1), [countless helpful resources,](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)[interesting blogs](https://pymotw.com/3/glob/index.html), and [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html). I've talked with others who need the in-person assistance that a bootcamp offers to learn. Do what works for you. Good luck with your decision.

**Update:** Several years later, I also get paid to use Python and Excel for a living! I studied for free online intermittently over 2 years to achieve it.
