This morning I'm meditating on my usual apps or websites I visit through the course of a typical day. I wonder how limited or expansive it could be in the span of all that's waiting to be consumed on the internet. I like reading online or physical books too and writing. Consider your own circle of the internet. What sites do you frequent? What do you consume? This is more rhetorical. It's good to pose the question and consider what you might be missing. I recently downloaded a bunch of nature and hiking apps. Maybe that means I want more of that in my life. [Happy trails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgw_yprN_-w&ab_channel=LiliDVLima).
