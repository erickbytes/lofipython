11 Ideas from people who have created great products, businesses, or ideas:

1.  Expertise in a field or product is one of the best assets. Nike's founders started out by making their prototype shoe designs themselves with a waffle iron. // [Shoe Dog](https://www.amazon.com/Shoe-Dog-Phil-Knight/dp/1508211809)
2.  Scratch your own itch. Create the product that you wish existed in the world. Write the book you want to read. // [Austin Kleon](https://austinkleon.com/steal/) // [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/)
3.  Observe a problem or inconvenience that exists in the world and create a better solution. // Product Development Class
4.  Find a niche and create something useful for that segment of people. // [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/)
5.  For every attribute, there is an opposite, effective attribute.[ // ]{style="line-height:1.7;"}[Law 14, The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing](https://blog.kowalczyk.info/articles/22-marketing-laws.html)
6.  Launch quickly, show to people, get feedback, and iterate your idea. // [Rework](https://37signals.com/rework)
7.  Use combinatory play. Take ideas from different disciplines and combine them to bring about new ideas. // [Brain Pickings](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/08/14/how-einstein-thought-combinatorial-creativity/)
8.  Invest in improving your product versus marketing. A great product is obvious to a potential customer. // [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/)
9.  [People remember how you or your product made them feel versus cost, etc.]{style="line-height:1.7;"}
10. An idea doesn't have to be revolutionary. Many new businesses or products take an existing product and make a slight modification or add a new twist.
11. Many of the successful people during the gold rush sold pick-axes to the miners.
