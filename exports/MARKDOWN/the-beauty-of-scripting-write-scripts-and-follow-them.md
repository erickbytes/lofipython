[Follow the three step path to enlightenment and productivity gained:]{style="font-size:inherit;"}

1.  Write scripts.
2.  Follow them manually.
3.  Refine and automate if preferable.

Below I "scripted" out catching my flight from Chicago's O'hare Airport to Denver. Writing things down is often the first step to realizing what needs done. Ideally, you'd turn those written steps into a script run from a shell or terminal. Then you might automate that code by scheduling it with [Windows Task Scheduler](http://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/11/25/automated-python-with-windows-task-scheduler/), Celery or Jenkins. But first, write it down in English.

"Scripting" means having a plan that delivers a result, then executing each step of the plan. Some benefits of scripting:

-   now I can adapt this script for every flight I take.
-   the information is there if I need it while traveling. I have an easy way to check my progress and ensure that I make my flight.
-   if I need to deviate from the script, I can see if it fits with my end goal of making the flight.
-   Peace of mind, especially if you can automate your task.
-   Mind space. My mind is freed up to concentrate on other ideas.

**To Automate or NotÂ **

Now if only I could automate my flight somehow! Maybe with a surrogate robot? There's probably a library for that on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/search/?q=robot). ðŸ˜‰

Some tasks are ripe for automation. In this case, I don't want to automate experiencing the beautiful mysticism of Colorado's mountains! But maybe I could try to automate parts of the flight experience like the online check-in? ðŸ¤”

**Free Up Space to Think**

The brainpower saved allowed me to write this post because I know I have 30 minutes until I need to leave according to my script listed below. Write scripts and follow them. Then automate them if possible. In the terminal or in life.
