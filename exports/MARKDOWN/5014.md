I'm hypothesizing that there is a tiny fraction of people searching related to "Amazon" who find my site from time to time. This made me wonder if there are people who may find my site looking for actual snakes rather than programming. So on that rare chance you're here for information about real snakes, maybe this will help! I wasn't sure where the law draws the line with snakes. It wasn't necessarily easy to pin down.

I found this [Large Constrictor Snake Final Rule: Questions and Answers](https://www.fws.gov/verobeach/PythonPDF/20150306%20LCS%20Final%20Rule%20QA%204.pdf) from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service very informative. The short answer is yes, it seems so? But the feds say you can't take your snake on vacation across state lines. Python Marketer has no dog in this fight and is simply curious to know the facts. (aka Google)

It seems that some snakes have "injurious" liability and are deemed not legal to cross state borders. It seems owning a Python is legal in in America. You do you, Snake kings.
