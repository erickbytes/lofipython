Today's discovery is `Python Koans <https://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans>`__.Â According to `python-guide.org <http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/intro/learning/>`__, Koans "uses a test-driven approach, q.v. TEST DRIVEN DESIGN SECTION to provide an interactive tutorial teaching basic Python concepts. By fixing assertion statements that fail in a test script, this provides sequential steps to learning Python."

I was also curious what a "Koan" actually is: "a paradox to be meditated upon that is used to train Zen Buddhist monks to abandon ultimate dependence on reason and to force them into gaining sudden intuitive enlightenment" - Merriam-Webster

Koans takes a little work to install. `Pygorithm <https://github.com/OmkarPathak/pygorithm>`__ is an similar package for learning advanced more algorithm theories with python, and can be more easily installed by `pip <https://github.com/OmkarPathak/pygorithm>`__.
