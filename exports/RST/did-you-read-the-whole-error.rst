You read the whole thing front to back? Every word? Stop and think about it. What is the computer trying to tell you?

Sometimes something is obvious but needs to be reminded. I found myself thinking this yet again today. Often there are times where I would have saved some time and grief by carefully reading the error.

Carefully read the error when you see a traceback. Then once you've taken it all in, consider what to do next. If you're stumped, googling it might yield a solution. But make sure you actually read the error first.
