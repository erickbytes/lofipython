Python's set of libraries are fun to explore. They allow Python to work with many types of other coding languages, allow you to do cool stuff, and seem to require a minimal knowledge of the actual code. You can read the complete list of standard libraries `here <https://docs.python.org/2/library/>`__. There are also others available that you can download and install for unique challenges or software such as `Android <https://wiki.python.org/moin/Android>`__.

Currently, my favorite library is `Tkinter <http://thinkingtkinter.sourceforge.net/>`__. Tkinter is a module that replicates `Tk/TCL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl>`__ within Python and allows you to create a quick Graphical User Interface (GUI) for your programs - great for trying to put together a prototype program with basic aesthetic design control for things like buttons, entry boxes, text and other visual elements that make up the front end of a computer program.

+Pro Tip: When you're trying to use a new module, you can read how to use it in the module's documentation. `Here's Tkinter's documentation <https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/tkinter.html>`__.
