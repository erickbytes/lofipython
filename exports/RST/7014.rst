Here's a deletion script that uses `os.remove() <https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.remove>`__ to delete files. Assuming the full path to the file is in a csv, with column named "files". It uses tqdm to display a progress bar as it is deleting the files. Short, sweet and it is surprisingly fast. I noted it averaged about 175 files deleted per second according to tqdm! At just 7 lines of code, this does the job. Give it a try!

**Install with**\ `pip <https://pythonmarketer.com/2018/01/20/how-to-python-pip-install-new-libraries/>`__:

   import os
   import pandas as pd
   from tqdm import tqdm
   csv = input("Enter csv with column name files:")
   df = pd.read_csv(csv)
   for path in tqdm(df.files):
       os.remove(path)
