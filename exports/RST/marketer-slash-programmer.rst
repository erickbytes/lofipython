I have studied and currently work in Marketing*, with around 5 years of experience. I would like to begin sharing my journey through the coding world. I have chosen Python as my language to explore, to start. I began last fall by completing three `free online courses on Coursera <https://www.coursera.org/learn/python>`__ - taught by an amazing professor, Dr. Charles Severance from the University of Michigan. Check 'em out if you want an epic introduction to Python and coding in general.

I previously had a little bit of HTML experience - nothing else - so I am very new to coding and enjoying learning a little more every day. I'm going to post my trials, problems, and things I figure out along the way and anything else I find interesting.

**Why do I want to learn to program?**

#. Rapidly growing segments of our lives rely on computers and similar technologies. It seems unwise to remain ignorant of their internal processes.
#. Web apps are cool, useful and make our lives better. I'd like to build them.
#. To strengthen myself professionally.
#. To CREATE - coding is actually a very great creative outlet.

**Why Python?**

It's a language that emphasizes readability, is very versatile and has a great community of users to help you solve problems. It can be used for everything from the front end - functionality, user interface, etc. to the back end - data storage, server use, etc.

My goal is to get better every day, and eventually build some cool shit.

Thank you for reading,

\*At the time I wrote this, I worked in a non-techincal marketing role. I've since moved into a role where I use Python nearly every day. If you're wondering how, I use `Pandas <https://pythonmarketer.wordpress.com/2018/05/12/pandas-pythons-excel-powerhouse/>`__, `Requests <https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/>`__ and Excel a lot at my current gig.
