> Lo-fi (also typeset as lofi or low-fi; short for low fidelity) is a music or production quality in which elements usually regarded as imperfections in the context of a recording or performance are present, sometimes as a deliberate choice.

The content folder contains all of the posts in reStructured Text format. The "exports" folder also contains the Wordpress importer script I used to convert the posts from my Wordpress blog, PythonMarketer.com. That blog is currently being migrated to LofiPython.com. I will be posting new stuff there in the future!

Lo-fi Python aims to find the "lo-fi" spirit of Python. 
Doing more with less. Favoring the standard library. 
Learning new libraries. Exploring the ecosystem with playful curiosity.
Embrace helping others by helping yourself. This is the way.
