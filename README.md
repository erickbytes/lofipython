> Lo-fi (also typeset as lofi or low-fi; short for low fidelity) is a music or production quality in which elements usually regarded as imperfections in the context of a recording or performance are present, sometimes as a deliberate choice. *Wikipedia*

As of May 2023, LofiPython.com is my current blog iteration for techical writing that is usually Python oriented but also covers general programming topics. The "content" folder contains all of the posts in reStructuredText format. The "exports" folder also contains the Wordpress importer script I used to convert the posts from my Wordpress blog.

You can read more about my blog workflow in my post, ["An Example Pelican + Git Blog Post Workflow"](https://lofipython.com/an-example-pelican-git-blog-post-workflow).

## The Spirit of Low Fidelity

Lo-fi Python aims to find the "lo-fi" spirit of Python. 
Doing more with less. Favoring the standard library. Lowest possible time to MVP (minimum viable product).
Learning new libraries. Exploring the ecosystem with playful curiosity.
Embrace helping others by helping yourself. This is the way.
